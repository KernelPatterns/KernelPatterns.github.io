[Torus](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#the-crank-of-a-partition) is basically a donut shape, which has the property of of having variable Gaussian curvature. \n\n```note\nThe blue parts of the torus above have positive curvature, the red parts negative and the top grey band has zero curvature.

Each generation contains two types of [leptons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lepton) and two types of [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark). The two leptons may be classified into one with [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge) −1 (electron-like) and neutral (neutrino); the two quarks may be classified into one with charge −1⁄3 (down-type) and one with charge +2⁄3 (up-type). \n\nThe basic features of quark–lepton generation or families, such as their masses and mixings etc., can be described by some of the proposed [family symmetries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_symmetries).\n```\n[![Basic Spin](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/3f10ad0d-9665-400a-b3fb-d676ebd64f33)\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generation_(particle_physics))\n\nA lepton is a particle of ***[half-integer spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-integer_spin)*** ([spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) 1⁄2) while a boson has ***integer spin***: [scalar boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_boson) (spin = 0), [vector bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_boson) (spin = 1) and tensor boson (spin = 2).\n\n```note\nThose particles with half-integer spins, are known as [fermions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion), while those particles with integer spins, such as 0, 1, 2, are known as [bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bosons).\n- The two families of particles obey different rules and broadly have different roles in the world around us. A key distinction between the two families is that fermions obey the [Pauli exclusion principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle): that is, there cannot be two identical fermions simultaneously having the same quantum numbers (meaning, roughly, having the same position, velocity and spin direction).

Also, composite particles can have spins different from their component particles.\n\nFor example, a [helium-4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Helium-4) atom in the ground state has spin 0 and behaves like a boson, even though the [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quarks) and electrons which make it up are all fermions. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)))_\n```\n\n[![spin in physics](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/bcdc40c1-e907-442e-8253-ff7eb1d08c14)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics))\n\n```note\nQuantum field theory is any theory that describes a quantized field.\n- QED, or Quantum Electrodynamics, is the quantum theory of the electromagnetic field, a so-called Abelian field (referencing an internal mathematical symmetry of the theory.)\n- Electroweak theory is a generalization of QED, unifying it with the weak nuclear force in the form of a Yang-Mills field theory (aka. a non-Abelian field theory).\n- QCD, or Quantum Chromodynamics, is another example of a non-Abelian field theory, but one with very different asymptotic behavior than electroweak theory.\n- The Standard Model of particle physics is the combination of electroweak theory and QCD in the form of a unified theory obeying a complex set of symmetries.\n\nThis theory describes all the known fields and all the known interactions other than gravity. _([Quora](https://www.quora.com/What-exactly-is-the-difference-between-QED-QCD-Electroweak-theory-Standard-model-Quantum-field-theory-and-how-are-they-related-together))_\n```\n\n![QED_10](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/effab3d3-7158-445a-aa34-9689f2725bfd)\n\nExperimental observation of the SM particles was completed by the discoveries of top quark (1995), direct interaction of tau neutrino (2000), and [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson) (2013).\n\n```note\n[Feynman diagram](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Feynman_diagram) of the fusion of ***two (2) [electroweak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electroweak) vector bosons*** to the scalar [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson), which is a prominent process of the generation of Higgs bosons at particle accelerators.

Here is a summary of the fundamental content of the standard model\n- There are three families of particle, the Quarks, the Leptons and the Gauge Bosons. The Quarks in groups of three forms the composite particles such as the Protons, along with the electron this forms ordinary matter.\n- The Gauge Bosons are the ones those are responsible for interactions. The Quarks interact among themselves by the exchange of a Gluon these are responsible for the strong nuclear force.\n- The newly discovered Higgs Boson interacts with all the Quarks and the first group of Leptons (electron, muon and tau) providing them with their mass. The neutrinos which are the other Leptons originally were thought to have zero mass, but recent discoveries argue that this is not the case.\n- The Weak bosons interact with both Leptons and Quarks, these are responsible for the Weak nuclear forces. The exchange of photon is responsible for the Electromagnetic Force.\n\nThey interact, they transfer energy and momentum and angular momentum; excitations are created and destroyed. Every excitation that’s possible has a reverse excitation. _([Quora](https://qr.ae/pK4Nd7))_\n```\n\n[![fundamental interaction in nature](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/284403402-a0ba27e5-1964-46c2-b7d8-72758eb0944d.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:Standard_Model/Archive_2)\n\nThe SM was basically developed in 1970-s.

[Fermions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion) are one of the two fundamental classes of particles, the other being [bosons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson). [Fermions](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fermion) have half-integer spin while [bosons](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boson) have integer spin.\n- Bosons are characterized by Bose–Einstein statistics and all have integer spins. Bosons may be either elementary, like photons and gluons, or composite, like mesons.\n- The Higgs boson is postulated by the electroweak theory primarily to explain the origin of particle masses. In a process known as the \"Higgs mechanism\", the Higgs boson and the other gauge bosons in the Standard Model acquire mass via spontaneous symmetry breaking of the SU(2) gauge symmetry.\n- The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model (MSSM) predicts several Higgs bosons. On 4 July 2012, the discovery of a new particle with a mass between 125 and 127 GeV/c2 was announced; physicists suspected that it was the Higgs boson. Since then, the particle has been shown to behave, interact, and decay in many of the ways predicted for Higgs particles by the Standard Model, as well as having even parity and zero spin, two fundamental attributes of a Higgs boson.\n- This also means it is the first elementary scalar particle discovered in nature. Elementary bosons responsible for the four fundamental forces of nature are called force particles (gauge bosons). Strong interaction is mediated by the gluon, weak interaction is mediated by the W and Z bosons.\n\nAccording to the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model_of_Particle_Physics) ***there are five (5) elementary bosons***:\n- One (1) [scalar boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scalar_boson) (***spin = 0***) \n [Higgs boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_boson) – the particle that contributes to the phenomenon of [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass) via the [Higgs mechanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higgs_mechanism)\n- Four (4) [vector bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_boson) (***spin = 1***) that act as [force carriers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_carriers).\n\n[![IMG_20240108_033415](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/044cb15e-36d7-4b44-aace-818a6d415917)](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_particles)\n\nThese four are the [gauge bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauge_boson):\n- [γ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon) [Photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon) – the force carrier of the [electromagnetic field](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetic_field)\n- [g](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon) [Gluons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon) (***eight (8) different types***) – force carriers that mediate the [strong force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction)\n- [Z](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_boson) [Neutral weak boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons) – the force carrier that mediates the [weak force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction)\n- [W±](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_boson) [Charged weak bosons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W_and_Z_bosons) (***two (2)types***) – force carriers that mediate the weak force\n\nA second order tensor boson (***spin = 2***) called the [graviton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton) (G) has been hypothesised as the force carrier for [gravity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_force), but so far all attempts to incorporate gravity into the Standard Model have failed.\n```\n\n[![Beyond the standard model](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/770d6abc-86d1-4195-b102-53e18fca3c10)](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13793234/the-physics-of-the-standard-model-and-beyond.pdf)\n\n```note\nThe diagram shows the elementary particles of the Standard Model (the Higgs boson, the three generations of quarks and leptons, and the gauge bosons), including their names, masses, spins, charges, chiralities, and interactions with the strong, weak and electromagnetic forces.

Thirty is the largest integer with this property.]\n- The integer 30, product of the first three prime numbers (2, 3 and 5), and thus a primorial, plays a powerful role organizing the array's perfect symmetry, viz., in the case of the 8 prime roots:\n\n1+29=30; 7+23=30; 11+19=30; and 13+17=30.\n\n- In The Number Mysteries well-known mathematician Marcus Du Sautoy writes: \"In the world of mathematics, the numbers 2, 3, and 5 are like hydrogen, helium, and lithium. That's what makes them the most important numbers in mathematics.\"\n- Although 2, 3 and 5 are the only prime numbers not included in the domain under discussion, they are nonetheless integral to it: First of all, they sieve out roughly 73% of all natural numbers, leaving only those nominally necessary to construct a geometry within which prime numbers can be optimally arrayed.\n- The remaining 26.66% (to be a bit more precise) constituting the array can be constructed with an elegantly simple interchangeable expression (or power series, if you prefer) that incorporates the first three primes. It's conjectured that this manifold series ultimately consists of all (and only) the numbers not divisible by 2, 3, or 5 (and their negatives), which inclues all prime numbers >5 (more below under the heading \"Conjectures and Facts Relating to the Prime Spiral Sieve\").\n\nWhat is critical to understand, is that the invisible hand of 2, 3 and 5, and their factorial 30, create the structure within which the balance of the prime numbers, i.e., all those greater than 5, are arrayed algorithmically–as we shall demonstrate. Primes 2, 3 and 5 play out in modulo 30-60-90 cycles (decomposing to {3,6,9} sequencing at the digital root level). Once the role of 2, 3 and 5 is properly understood, all else falls beautifully into place. _([PrimesDemystified](https://primesdemystified.com/#Distribution_of_Perfect_Squares))_\n```\n\n[![One_Grand_Pyramid_Teaser](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/31cec66a-566f-466d-9ea6-f924e7499f01)](https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html)\n\n","dir":"/addition/","name":"2.md","path":"addition/2.md","url":"/addition/2.html"},{"layout":"default","title":null,"content":"\n{% include list.liquid all=true %}\n\n[Prime hexagon](https://www.hexspin.com/) is a mathematical structure developed by mathematician T.

That every even number should consist of the sum of two primes.\n- All pairs of prime numbers without \"1\", 2, 3, 5, we call henceforth Goldbach pairs. The MEC 30 transforms this idea of Christian Goldbach into the structure of a numerical double-strand, into an opposing member of the MEC 30 scale.\n- We call this double strand a convolution, which results in an opposite arrangement. It represents the natural vibration, thus also the redundant vibrations in the energy transfer. In the 6 For example, in the graph, the even number 60 is folded. At folding of the even number 60 6 result in 8 prime pairs.\n- In this case, among the 8 pairs of prime pairs there are only 6 Goldbach pairs. 2 prime positions in the prime position pairs carry products of the factors \"1 × 1\" and 7 × 7. Thus, 2 prime pairs do not fulfill the requirements of the Goldbach pairs. In general, any even number larger than 30 can be represented graphically within a cycle (MEC 30) as a specific cyclic convolution. This characteristic convolution of the even numbers is a fundamental test element in the numerical table. The result Even the even numbers to infinity occupy a fixed position within the 30s system MEC 30. The even numbers thus have 15 positions: 30/2 = 15 even positions of the MEC 30.\n- There are therefore only 15 even positions for all even numbers to infinity. Every even number has a specific convolution due to its position in the 30s system. First, we have to determine the positions of the even numbers in the 30s system to make them one in the following graph 7 attributable to the 15 specific folds.\n```\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74591945-2b75cb80-504f-11ea-85dd-14d0a803ee6b.png)\n\n```txt\np r i m e s\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n2 1 0 0 0 1 ◄--- #29 ◄--- #61 ✔️\n3 2 0 1 0 2\n4 3 1 1 0 3\n5 5 2 1 0 5\n6 7 3 1 0 7 ◄--- #23\n7 11 4 1 0 11 ◄--- #19\n8 13 5 1 0 13 ◄--- # 17 ◄--- #49 ✔️\n9 17 0 1 1 17 ◄--- 7th prime 👉 7s\n10 19 1 1 1 ∆1 ◄--- 0th ∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #18\n-----\n11 23 2 1 1 ∆2 ◄--- 1st ∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #19 ◄--- #43 ✔️\n..\n..\n40 163 5 1 0 ∆31 ◄- 11th ∆prime ◄-- Fibonacci Index #29 👉 11\n-----\n41 167 0 1 1 ∆0\n42 173 0 -1 1 ∆1\n43 179 0 1 1 ∆2 ◄--- ∆∆1\n44 181 1 1 1 ∆3 ◄--- ∆∆2 ◄--- 1st ∆∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #30\n..\n..\n100 521 0 -1 2 ∆59 ◄--- ∆∆17 ◄--- 7th ∆∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #36 👉 7s\n-----\n```\n\n## Palindromic Sequence \n\n```note\nIn the matrix pictured below, we list the first 24 elements of our domain, take their squares, calculate the modulo 90 congruence and digital roots of each square, and display the digital root factorization dyad for each square (and map their ***collective bilateral 9 sum symmetry***). _([PrimesDemystified](https://primesdemystified.com/))_\n```\n\n***7 x π(89) = 7 x 24 = 168 = π(1000)***\n\n[![collective bilateral 9 sum symmetry](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/200229388-03811f48-2492-4845-b15f-85259cd93717.png)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#elementary-structure)\n\n```txt\np r i m e s\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n2 1 0 0 0 1 ◄--- #29 ◄--- #61\n3 2 0 1 0 2 👉 2 ✔️\n4 3 1 1 0 3 👉 61 - 1 = 60 ✔️\n5 5 2 1 0 5\n6 7 3 1 0 7 ◄--- #23\n7 11 4 1 0 11 ◄--- #19\n8 13 5 1 0 13 ◄--- # 17 ◄--- #49\n9 17 0 1 1 17 ◄--- 7th prime 👉 7s\n10 19 1 1 1 ∆1 ◄--- 0th ∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #18\n-----\n11 23 2 1 1 ∆2 ◄--- 1st ∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #19 ◄--- #43\n..\n..\n40 163 5 1 0 ∆31 ◄- 11th ∆prime ◄-- Fibonacci Index #29 👉 11\n-----\n41 167 0 1 1 ∆0\n42 173 0 -1 1 ∆1\n43 179 0 1 1 ∆2 ◄--- ∆∆1\n44 181 1 1 1 ∆3 ◄--- ∆∆2 ◄--- 1st ∆∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #30\n..\n..\n100 521 0 -1 2 ∆59 ◄--- ∆∆17 ◄--- 7th ∆∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #36 👉 7s\n-----\n```\n\n```note\nThe color spin addresses for numbers are generally straightforward – a composite number takes the spin of the prior prime. 4 spins blue because 3 spins blue. 8 is red because 7 is red.

The information of the prime number products translates our theory into a checkerboard-like pattern using the finite 8 prime positions from the MEC 30, we call it Ikon. 8 × 8 primary positions = 64 primary positions of the checkerboard icon.\n- First, there are two main features that we use. To Ikon 1: The primes information and their products. In this left icon, the redundants (the doubles) are to be determined through the number information in the positions Impeccable.\n- Second: The product positions. In the icon, the cyclic behavior is shown in identical 8 horizontal and 8 vertical orders, we call these orders templates that would not be visible through the pure number information. The cyclical behavior of the 8 × 8 product positions continues indefinitely.\n- Since the prime positions are finite, a total of 8 positions in the 30th order, an already revolutionary system opens up, the entire infinite distribution of the prime number products in an icon as a \"checkerboard pattern\". represent and thus obtain mathematically exact results.\n- The three and 4 , Square Graphics (Ikon) will now be in the following, larger graphic 5 transfer. As stated above, we use the properties of the numbers, they consist of one information and one position. Thus we are able to calculate the redundant product positions by means of identical information in different positions.\n- And subtracting them from the total prime positions gives us the number of prime numbers. This succeeds due to the self-similarity of the 30th order of the MEC 30, as shown in the graph 5 is articulated. At the top of the following larger graphic 5 the self-similarity of the 30th order (MEC 30) can be seen.\n- This results in a fundamental causal relation to the primes, systemically the products are entered into the position system. Therefore, the distribution of primes products also determines the distribution of primes themselves. The reason lies in the one-system, since the prime number as a number itself also consists of an information and a position.\n\nWe apply the same principle as above for the determination of the prime position. Only with the difference that we move in the even positions of the MEC 30.\n```\n\n***7 x π(89) = 7 x 24 = 168 = π(1000)***\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/244855108-b80b3c2e-1a13-4b55-828a-72ed15b448dd.png)\n\n[![Theory of Everything](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/6e26ada0-c545-4771-810b-9f721512a03c)](https://www.primesdemystified.com/Factorization.html)\n","dir":"/addition/","name":"3.md","path":"addition/3.md","url":"/addition/3.html"},{"layout":"default","title":null,"content":"{% include list.liquid all=true %}\n\n![image](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/a4e57e16-8334-4270-bce7-9739e30df21a)\n\n***(10 - 2) th prime = 8th prime = 19***\n\n[![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/200228711-996e52bf-887c-445d-ad4b-46da2eabc30e.png)](https://gist.github.com/eq19/0ce5848f7ad62dc46dedfaa430069857#the-implementation)\n\nThe subclasses of partitions systemically develops characters similar to the distribution of prime numbers. \n\n[![Rank of a partition](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/227838045-3ddd5238-7beb-4023-affa-c61a054afd2b.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rank_of_a_partition)\n\ntps://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#partition-function) represents the number of possible partitions of a non-negative integer n.\n\n***f(8 twins) = 60 - 23 = 37 inner partitions***\n\n```txt\np r i m e s\n1 0 0 0 0 0\n2 1 0 0 0 1 ◄--- #29 ◄--- #61\n3 2 0 1 0 2 👉 2\n4 3 1 1 0 3 👉 89 -29 = 61 - 1 = 60 ✔️\n5 5 2 1 0 5 👉 f(37) = f(8 twins) ✔️\n6 7 3 1 0 7 ◄--- #23\n7 11 4 1 0 11 ◄--- #19\n8 13 5 1 0 13 ◄--- # 17 ◄--- #49\n9 17 0 1 1 17 ◄--- 7th prime 👉 7s\n10 19 1 1 1 ∆1 ◄--- 0th ∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #18\n-----\n11 23 2 1 1 ∆2 ◄--- 1st ∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #19 ◄--- #43\n..\n..\n40 163 5 1 0 ∆31 ◄- 11th ∆prime ◄-- Fibonacci Index #29 👉 11\n-----\n41 167 0 1 1 ∆0\n42 173 0 -1 1 ∆1\n43 179 0 1 1 ∆2 ◄--- ∆∆1\n44 181 1 1 1 ∆3 ◄--- ∆∆2 ◄--- 1st ∆∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #30\n..\n..\n100 521 0 -1 2 ∆59 ◄--- ∆∆17 ◄--- 7th ∆∆prime ◄--- Fibonacci Index #36 👉 7s\n-----\n```\n\n***7 + 13 + 19 + 25 = 64 = 8 × 8 = 8²***\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/83051968-e2cfa480-a078-11ea-8ff2-316a809a8fad.jpg)\n\n## Subclasses of Partitions\n\n```note\nLet weighted points be given in the plane .

And it is the fact that 168 divided by 24 is ***exactly seven (7)***.\n\n```note\nSurprisingly, the 24-cell hexagon confines all natural numbers. The reason: no prime numbers occupy a cell with a right or left wall on the t-hexagon’s outer boundary, other than 2 and 3, the initial primes that forced the number line into this complex coil. Without a prime number in the outer set of triangles, the number line does not change to an outward course and ***remains forever contained in the 24 cells***. _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/))_\n```\n\n[![Euler Partition](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/b73fec0f-1798-4679-bbc2-ed6060484543)](https://eq19.com/identition/#euler-partition)\n\nYou may notice that there are twists and turns until 19 abuts 2 therefore this addition zone takes only the seven (7) primes out of the 18's structure of _[True Prime Pairs](https://www.eq19.com/addition/file02.html#true-prime-pairs)_.\n\n```\n$True Prime Pairs:\n(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n \nlayer | node | sub | i | f\n------+------+-----+----------\n | | | 1 | --------------------------\n | | 1 +-----+ | \n | 1 | | 2 | (5) |\n | |-----+-----+ |\n | | | 3 | |\n 1 +------+ 2 +-----+---- |\n | | | 4 | |\n | +-----+-----+ |\n | 2 | | 5 | (7) |\n | | 3 +-----+ |\n | | | 6 | 11s\n------+------+-----+-----+------ } (36) |\n | | | 7 | |\n | | 4 +-----+ |\n | 3 | | 8 | (11) |\n | +-----+-----+ |\n | | | 9 | |\n 2 +------| 5 +-----+----- |\n | | | 10 | |\n | |-----+-----+ |\n | 4 | | 11 | (13) ---------------------\n | | 6 +-----+\n | | | 12 |---------------------------\n------+------+-----+-----+------------ |\n | | | 13 | |\n | | 7 +-----+ |\n | 5 | | 14 | (17) |\n | |-----+-----+ |\n | | | 15 | 7s √\n 3 +------+ 8 +-----+----- } (36) |\n | | | 16 | |\n | |-----+-----+ |\n | 6 | | 17 | (19) |\n | | 9 +-----+ |\n | | | 18 | --------------------------\n------|------|-----+-----+------\n```\n\nThe tessellating field of equilateral triangles fills with numbers, with spin orientation flipping with each prime number encountered, creating ***3 minor hexagons***.\n\n```tip\nPrime numbers are numbers that have only 2 factors: 1 and themselves.\n- For example, the first 5 prime numbers are 2, 3, 5, 7, and 11. By contrast, numbers with more than 2 factors are call composite numbers.\n- 1 is not a prime number because it can not be divided by any other integer except for 1 and itself. The only factor of 1 is 1.\n- On the other hand, 1 is also not a composite number because it can not be divided by any other integer except for 1 and itself.\n\nIn conclusion, the number 1 is neither prime nor composite.\n```\n\n***π(6+11) = π(17) = 7***\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/274093531-0878e3e5-6be3-448e-9ad4-3b34523c1e9c.jpg)\n\nSo there should be a tight connection between 168 primes within 1000 with the _[24-cell hexagon](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#assigning-a-lexer)_. Indeed it is also correlated with [1000 prime numbers](https://www.primesdemystified.com/First1000Primes.html).\n\n## Undiscovered Features\n\nWhen we continue the spin within the discussed prime hexagon with the higher numbers there are the six (6) internal hexagons within the Prime Hexagon. \n\n```note\nCell types are interesting, but they simply reflect a ***modulo 6 view of numbers***. More interesting are the six internal hexagons within the Prime Hexagon. Like the Prime Hexagon, they are newly discovered. The minor hexagons form solely from the order, and type, of primes along the number line _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/minor-hexagons/))_.\n```\n\n![Screen-Shot-2016-11-07-at-5 11 59-PM](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/226644534-00cf4fe3-04f9-4b28-8a8b-674bcf4bd585.png)\n\nSo the most important thing that need to be investigated is ***why the prime spinned by module six (6)***. What is the special thing about this number six (6) in primes behaviour?\n\n```note\nSimilarly, I have a six colored dice in the form of the hexagon. If I take a known, logical sequence of numbers, say 10, 100, 1000, 10000, and look at their spins in the hexagon, the resulting colors associated with each number should appear random – ***unless the sequence I’m investigating is linked to the nature of the prime numbers***.\n```\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74550123-6dd1d680-4f83-11ea-8810-3b8f4f50a9c0.png)\n\nMoreover there are view statements mentioned by the provider which also bring us in to an attention like the modulo 6 above. We put some of them below.\n\n```note\nThat is, if the powers of 10 all returned with blue spin, or as a series of rainbows, or evenly alternating colors or other non-random results, ***then I’d say prime numbers appear to have a linkage to 10. I may not know what the the linkage is, just that it appears to exist*** _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/minor-hexagons/))_.\n```\n\n![image](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/36441664/8997b388-e0b8-481f-a763-76a46a07e085)\n\nAnother is that phi and its members have a pisano period if the resulting fractional numbers are truncated. \n\n```note\nI wondered if that property might hold for the incremental powers of phi as well. For this reason I chose to see numbers in the hexagon as quantum, and truncate off the decimal values to determine which integer cell they land in. That is what I found. ***Phi and its members have a pisano period if the resulting fractional numbers are truncated***. _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/phi-not-pi-and-why-i-truncate-to-determine-integer-values/))_.\n```\n\n[![truncated fractional numbers](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/229198281-8dbd72fb-cd0b-46c3-8a2c-ddc66107333e.png)](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#the-powers-of-pi)\n\nIt would mean that there should be undiscovered things hidden within the residual of this decimal values. In fact it is the case that happen with _[3-forms in 7D](https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#the-seven-7-groups)_.\n\n## Dimensional Algorithms\n\nLet's consider a prime spin theory of compactifying the 7-dimensional manifold on the 3-sphere of a fixed radius and study its [dimensional reduction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dimensional_reduction\n) to 4D.\n\n```note\nProceeding, the number line begins to coil upon itself; 20 lands on 2’s cell, 21 on 3’s cell. Prime number 23 sends the number line left to form the fourth (4th) hexagon, purple. As it is not a twin, the clockwise progression (rotation) reverses itself. Twin primes ***29 and 31 define the fifth (5th) hexagon***, cyan. Finally, 37, again not a twin, reverses the rotation of the system, so 47 can define the yellow hexagon _([HexSpin](https://www.hexspin.com/defining-the-prime-hexagon/))_.\n```\n\n![IMG_20231221_074421](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/1e7dc443-b7d8-44d9-8da0-5fe50dd7ee70)\n\nTaking 19 as a certain parameter we can see that the left handed cycles are happen on ***5th-spin*** (forms 4th hexagon, purple) and ***6th-spin*** (forms 5th hexagon, cyan). Both have different rotation with other spin below 9th spin (forms 6th hexagon, yellow).\n\n```note\nAll perfect squares within our domain (numbers not divisible by 2, 3 or 5) possess a digital root of 1, 4 or 7 and are congruent to either {1} or {19} modulo 30.\n- ***When the digital root of perfect squares is sequenced within a modulo 30 x 3 = modulo 90 horizon, beautiful symmetries in the form of period-24 palindromes are revealed***.

Also, the sum of the multiplicative digital roots = 108 x 24 = 2592 = 432 x 6.\n- Note: Channels A, D, E and F combined represent the set of natural numbers not divisible by 2, 3 and 5, the first 24 elements of which form the basis of the [Magic Mirror Matrix](https://www.primesdemystified.com/magicmatrix.html).\n- The graphic below illustrates the transformative relationships between the matrices employing their primary building blocks (one of the sixteen identical 6 x 6 (36 element) Latin Squares that constitute each matrix)\n- When you rotate either the {1,4,7} or {2,5,8} magic square around its horizontal axis, i.e. columns {A,B,C} become {C,B,A}, then add the {1,4,7} {2,5,8} magic squares together, you produce a square with nine 9's. For example, ***adding the first rows of each gives us: {2,8,5} + {7,1,4} = {9,9,9}***.\n- Triangles and magic squares similar–or identical–to those shown above can be derived from the digital root sequence cycles of all three twin prime distribution channels (namely numbers ≌ to {11,13}, {17,19} and {1,29} modulo 30).\n- This is also true of dyads formed by ***paired radii of the Prime Spiral Sieve that sum to 30***, i.e., numbers ≌ to {1,29}, {7,23}, {11,19}, or {13,17} modulo 30, as well as dyads formed when {n, n + 10} are ≌ to {1, 11}, {7, 17}, {13, 23} or {19, 29} modulo 30 (note their pairing by terminating digits). One example relating to twin primes: The first three candidate pairs in the twin prime distribution channel ≌ to {11,13} modulo 30 (all three of which are indeed twin primes) sequence their digital roots as follows:\n - **{11,13} = digital roots 2 & 4**\n - **{41,43} = digital roots 5 & 7**\n - **{71,73} = digital roots 8 & 1**.\n- As you can see, this is the same digital root sequence illustrated above. It appears that the triangulations and magic squares structuring the distribution of twin primes (and as it turns out, all prime numbers) have a genesis in universal principles involving symmetry groups ***rotated by the 8-dimensional algorithms*** discussed at length on this site.\n- You can see this universal principle at work, for example, with regard to the Fibonacci digital root sequence when coupled to a pair of dyads that follow certain incremental rules. As we illustrated above, the initializing dyad of ***the period-24 Fibonacci digital root sequence*** is {1,1, ...}.\n\nWe can generate triangles and magic squares by tiering the Fibonacci digital root sequence with two pairs of terms that are + 3 or + 6 from the initial terms {1,1}. The values of the 2nd and 3rd tiers, or rows, must differ, or symmetry is lost. In other words, ***the first two columns should read either {1,4,7 + 1,7,4, or vice versa} but not {1,4,7 + 1,4,7, or 1,7,4, + 1,7,4}***. _([PrimesDemystified](https://www.primesdemystified.com/twinprimes.html))_\n```\n\n[![Multiplication_Matrix_Transforms](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/2b8e8a2b-4bbd-4562-a907-9cad0dc61f76)](https://www.primesdemystified.com/twinprimes.html)\n\nThe above seven (7) primes will act then as ***[extended branes](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/D-brane)***.

We've dubbed this object a 'palindromagon' given that the coordinates of the 18 triangulations produced by the digital root dyadic cycles in the order sequenced sum to a palindrome: 639 693 963 369 396 936.\n- Remarkably, this periodic palindrome, with additive sum of 108, sequences the 6 possible permutations of values {3,6,9}. Interesting to consider a geometric object with a hidden palindromic dimension. But that's not all: When the six triadic permutations forming the palindrome are labeled A, B, C, D, E, F in the order generated, ACE and BDF form 3 x 3 Latin squares. In both cases all rows, columns and principal diagonals sum to 18:\n\n - ***ACE ... BDF***\n - 693 ... 639\n - 369 ... 963\n - 936 ... 396\n\n- The output of these algorithmically sequenced triangulations is fundamentally a geometric representation of the twin prime distribution channels (and, as we noted above, the same geometry is expressed in factorization sequencing, albeit the vertices may be ordered differently.\n- This is because each set of three generator dyads roots to the same six elements: 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, 8. Thus, for example, dyad sets ({1,2} {4,5} {7,8}) and ({2,4} {5,7} {8,1}) will generate identical complex polygons, despite their vertices being sequenced in different orders.).\n\nIt's remarkable that ***objects consisting of star polygons, spiraling irregular pentagons***, and possessing nonagon perimeters and centers, can be constructed from only ***27 coordinates pointing to 9 triangles in 3 variations***.

And this 30th order repeats itself to infinity. Even in the first 30s system, therefore, the positions are fixed in which the number information positions itself to infinity. We call it the first member of the MEC 30.\n- The numbers not divisible by 2, 3 or 5 are highlighted. We call them prime positions, hence 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. Important for our work is that in the following the term prime refers only to prime numbers that are in the prime positions. So primes 2, 3 and 5 are always excluded.\n- These positions: 1 7 11 13 17 19 23 29. We refer to this basic system as MEC 30 - \"Mathematical Elementary Cell 30\". By repeating the positions we show the function of the basic system in the next step. If we extend the 30th order of the MEC, for example, to the number 120, the result is ***4 times a 30th order*** and thus 4 × 8 = 32 prime positions.\n- Hypothetical assumption: If the product of the primes (except 2, 3, 5,) would not fall into the prime positions, thus be divided by 2, 3 or 5, the information would have 120 = 32 primes in 32 prime positions: 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, / 31, 37, 41, 43, 47, 49, 53, 59, / 61, 67, 71, 73, 77, 79, 83, 89, / 91, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 119\n- These forms gives prime positions: 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, / 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29, / 1, 7, 11, 13, 17 , 19, 23, 29, / 1, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29. The 30th order is repeated in the number space ***120 = 4 times, 4 × 8 = 32 prime positions, thus 4 terms***.\n\nFrom our consideration we can conclude that the distribution of prime numbers must have a static base structure, which is also confirmed logically in the further course. This static structure is altered by the products of the primes themselves, since these products must fall into the prime positions since they are not divisible by 2, 3 and 5. _([Google Patent DE102011101032A9](https://patents.google.com/patent/DE102011101032A9/en#similarDocuments))_\n```\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/36441664/74366957-992db780-4e03-11ea-8f26-cca32bd26003.png)\n\n```note\nSpeaking of iterative digital division–a powerful tool for exposing structure–we get this astonishing equation: iteratively dividing the digital roots of the first 12 Fibonacci numbers times the divisively iterated 1000th prime, 7919, times 3604 gives us 1000.

We have presented an improved Bajard-Imbert-type full RNS algorithm that can also operate on inputs represented by pseudo-residues.\n- Using this algorithm, we have developed a multi-layer RNS that is ***capable of implementing modular addition, subtraction and multiplication for very large moduli*** by only using actual arithmetic for a fixed set of moduli. If the moduli of this fixed set are sufficiently small, the method allows for a fully table-based implementation.\n- In contrast to digit-based implementations of modular operations for large moduli, our method allows for a massively parallel implementation and is completely carry- free, thus thwarting potential attacks exploiting such carries, e.g., with side-channel analysis or in a white-box cryptography context.\n- Our system may be considered as a method to provide a given, fixed RNS with a very large dynamical range. To illustrate the method, we have described a 2-layer RNS system that can be used to implement an RSA ***exponentiation by adding the desired RSA modulus on top in a third layer***.\n- The system employs 19 moduli of 8-bits each in the bottom layer and can be used to implement an RSA exponentiation for 2048-bits RSA moduli with all the required arithmetic done by table look-up, using 19 modular addition tables and 19 modular multiplication tables, each of these 38 tables having size 2⁸ × 2⁸ × 8 bits, with one modular multiplication taking approximately 160,000 table look-ups.\n\nWe further observed that in order to change the RSA modulus, only some constants for computing on the top layer with moduli on the middle layer need to be updated. This update need not be computed in a secure manner and hence can be done quickly. _([Recursive Residues - pdf](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1801.07561))_\n```\n\n***π(π(30+37)) = π(π(67)) = π(19) = 8***\n\n```bash\n#!/usr/bin/env bash\n\nedit_file () {\n\n NUM=$(($2 + 0))\n \n while IFS=' ' read -ra SPIN; do\n T+=(\"${SPIN[0]}\")\n R+=(\"${SPIN[1]}\")\n A+=(\"${SPIN[2]}\")\n C+=(\"${SPIN[3]}\")\n K+=(\"${SPIN[4]}\")\n I+=(\"${SPIN[5]}\")\n N+=(\"${SPIN[6]}\")\n G+=(\"${SPIN[7]}\")\n done < /tmp/spin.txt\n\n FRONT=\"---\\n\"\n FRONT+=\"sort: ${K[$NUM]}\\n\"\n FRONT+=\"span: ${I[$NUM]}\\n\"\n FRONT+=\"spin: ${N[$NUM]}\\n\"\n FRONT+=\"suit: ${G[$NUM]}\\n\"\n FRONT+=\"---\\n\"\n\n IFS=$'\\n' read -d '' -r -a LINE < _Sidebar.md\n TEXT=\"${LINE[$NUM]}\" && TITLE=${TEXT%|*}\n FRONT+=\"# $TITLE\\n\\n\"\n\n [[ $NUM -le 9 ]] && sed -i \"1s|^|$FRONT|\" $1\n if [[ $NUM -lt 2 || $NUM == 9 ]]; then\n mv -f $1 ${1%/*}/README.md\n sed '1,6!d' ${1%/*}/README.md\n fi\n}\n\nFILE=${1##*/} && SORT=${FILE%.*}\n[[ $SORT =~ ^-?[0-9]+$ ]] && edit_file $1 $SORT\n```\n\nThese representations are a curious finding.

Mesons such as qqq¯q¯ and baryons such as qqqqq¯ would also have integral charges.

The [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) of a [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle) may be used to define a handedness, or helicity, for that particle, which, in the case of a massless particle, is the same as chirality. A [symmetry transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_transformation) between the two is called [parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(physics)) transformation. Invariance under parity transformation by a [Dirac fermion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_fermion) is called chiral symmetry.\n- For massless particles – photons, gluons, and (hypothetical) gravitons – chirality is the same as helicity; a given massless particle appears to [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) in the same direction along its axis of motion regardless of point of view of the observer.\n- For massive particles – such as electrons, quarks, and neutrinos – chirality and helicity must be distinguished: In the case of these particles, it is possible for an observer to change to a reference frame moving faster than the spinning particle, in which case the particle will then appear to move backwards, and its helicity (which may be thought of as \"apparent chirality\") will be reversed. That is, helicity is a constant of motion, but it is not Lorentz invariant. Chirality is Lorentz invariant, but is not a constant of motion: a massive left-handed spinor, when propagating, will evolve into a right handed spinor over time, and vice versa.\n- A massless particle moves with the speed of light, so no real observer (who must always travel at less than the speed of light) can be in any reference frame where the particle appears to reverse its relative direction of spin, meaning that all real observers see the same helicity. Because of this, the direction of spin of massless particles is not affected by a change of inertial reference frame (a Lorentz boost) in the direction of motion of the particle, and the sign of the projection (helicity) is fixed for all reference frames: The helicity of massless particles is a relativistic invariant (a quantity whose value is the same in all inertial reference frames) which always matches the massless particle's chirality.\n\nThe discovery of neutrino oscillation implies that neutrinos have mass, so the photon is the only confirmed massless particle; gluons are expected to also be massless, although this has not been conclusively tested.[b] Hence, these are the only two particles now known for which helicity could be identical to chirality, and only the photon has been confirmed by measurement.

It is negative (\"left-handed\") if the directions of spin and motion are opposite. So a standard [clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock), with its spin vector defined by the rotation of its hands, has left-handed helicity if tossed with its face directed forwards.\n- Mathematically, helicity is the sign of the projection of the [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric)) onto the [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum) [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric)): ***\"left\" is negative, \"right\" is positive.\nhave mass and thus may have different helicities in different reference frames***.\n- Chiral theories: Particle physicists have only observed or inferred left-chiral fermions and right-chiral antifermions engaging in the charged weak interaction.[1] In the case of the weak interaction, which can in principle engage with both left- and right-chiral fermions, only two left-handed fermions interact. Interactions involving right-handed or opposite-handed fermions have not been shown to occur, ***implying that the universe has a preference for left-handed chirality***. This preferential treatment of one chiral realization over another violates parity, as first noted by Chien Shiung Wu in her famous experiment known as the Wu experiment. This is a striking observation, since parity is a symmetry that holds for all other fundamental interactions.\n- Chirality for a Dirac fermion ψ is defined through the operator γ5, which has eigenvalues ±1; the eigenvalue's sign is equal to the particle's chirality: +1 for right-handed, −1 for left-handed. Any Dirac field can thus be projected into its ***left- or right-handed*** component by acting with the projection operators.[![Right_left_helicity svg](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/6a9a0f44-a1ed-41e5-878f-62948c19d9de)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-right_model)\n- The coupling of the charged weak interaction to fermions is proportional to the first projection operator, which is responsible for this interaction's parity symmetry violation.\n- A common source of confusion is due to conflating the γ5, chirality operator with the helicity operator. Since the helicity of massive particles is frame-dependent, it might seem that the same particle would interact with the weak force according to one frame of reference, but not another. The resolution to this paradox is that the chirality operator is equivalent to helicity for massless fields only, for which helicity is not frame-dependent. By contrast, for massive particles, chirality is not the same as helicity, or, alternatively, helicity is not Lorentz invariant, so there is no frame dependence of the weak interaction: a particle that couples to the weak force in one frame does so in every frame.\n- A theory that is asymmetric with respect to chiralities is called a chiral theory, while a non-chiral (i.e., parity-symmetric) theory is sometimes called a vector theory. Many pieces of the Standard Model of physics are non-chiral, which is traceable to anomaly cancellation in chiral theories. Quantum chromodynamics is an example of a vector theory, since both chiralities of all quarks appear in the theory, and couple to gluons in the same way.\n- ***The electroweak theory, developed in the mid 20th century, is an example of a chiral theory***. Originally, it assumed that neutrinos were massless, and assumed the existence of only left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos. After the observation of neutrino oscillations, which imply that neutrinos are massive (like all other fermions) the revised theories of the electroweak interaction now include both right- and left-handed neutrinos. However, it is still a chiral theory, as it does not respect parity symmetry.\n- The exact nature of the neutrino is still unsettled and so the electroweak theories that have been proposed are somewhat different, but most accommodate the chirality of neutrinos in the same way as was already done for all other fermions.\n\nBy Chiral symmetry the Vector gauge theories with massless Dirac fermion fields ψ exhibit chiral symmetry, i.e., rotating the left-handed and the right-handed components independently makes no difference to the theory. We can write this as the action of rotation on the fields:\n```\n\n![Symmetry State](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/70cb2eb0-0955-4d18-8400-e05ac1b9d325)\n\nThe Standard Model with massive neutrinos need ***7 more parameters*** (3 [CKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabibbo%E2%80%93Kobayashi%E2%80%93Maskawa_matrix) and 4 [PMNS matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMNS_matrix) parameters) for a total of _[26 parameters](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/15.html#parity-order)_.

A comparison between the salient features of quark and lepton flavor mixing structures is also made.\n- The SM contains thirteen free flavor parameters in its electroweak sector: three charged-lepton masses,\nsix quark masses, three quark flavor mixing angles and one CP-violating phase.\n- Since the three neutrinos must be massive beyond the SM, one has to introduce seven (or nine) extra free parameters to describe their flavor properties: three neutrino masses, three lepton flavor mixing angles and one (or three) CP-violating phase(s), corresponding to their Dirac (or Majorana) nature a\n- The ***3x3 lepton vs quark mixing matrices*** appearing in the weak charged-current interactions are referred to, respectively, as the ***Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS)*** matrix Uand the ***Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)*** matrix V which all the fermion fields are the mass eigenstates.\n- By convention, U and V are defined to be associated with W− and W+, respectively. Note that V is unitary as dictated by the SM itself, but whether U is unitary or not depends on the mechanism responsible for the origin of neutrino masses.\n- The charged leptons and quarks with the same electriccharges all have the normal mass hierarchies (namely, me ≪ mµ ≪ mτ, mu ≪ mc ≪ mt and md ≪ ms ≪ m. Yet it remains unclear whether the three neutrinos also have a normal mass ordering (m1 < m2 < m3) or not. Now that m1 < m2 has been fixed from the solar neutrino oscillations, ***the only likely “abnormal” mass ordering is m3 < m1 < m2***\n- The neutrino mass ordering is one of the central concerns in flavor physics, and it will be determined in the foreseeable future with the help of either an accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiment or a reactor-based antineutrino oscillation experiment, or both of them. Up to now the moduli of nine elements of the CKM matrix V have been determined from current experimental data to a good degree of accuracy.\n\nHere our focus is on the ***five (5) parameters*** of strong and weak CP violation. In the quark sector, the strong CP-violating phase θ remains unknown, but the weak CP-violating phase δq has been determined to a good degree of accuracy.

This factor implies a massless neutrino [1]: “Nature had the choice of an aesthetically satisfying, but a left-right, symmetry violating theory, with a neutrino which travels exactly with the same velocity of light; or alternatively a theory where left-right symmetry is preserved, but the neutrino has a tiny mass – some ten thousand times smaller than the mass of the electron.”\nThe neutrino masslessness is also stated by other authors. A review article on neutrino properties states that “two-components left-handed massless neutrino fields play a crucial role in the determination of the charged current structure of the Standard Model” (see the Abstract of [2]). Similarly, a Quantum Field Theory textbook states: “Thus, massless neutrinos are a prediction of the Standard Model” (see [4], p. 555). Indeed, a massless neutrino is the basis for the two-component Weyl neutrino, which shows parity violation (see e.g. section 2.2 of [2]). The same argument appears on p. 139 of [3].\n\nOn the other hand, a recent review article negates the foregoing ides and states that it is now admitted “that neutrinos can no longer be considered as massless particles” (see [5], p. 1307). This statement is adopted by the Particle Data Group [6], which is the authorized organization for the definition of reliable particle data. The recognition of this fact by the community was demonstrated by the 2015 Nobel Prize, awarded to the persons who have discovered this property [7].\nIt follows that the experimentally confirmed massive neutrino undermines the basis of the Standard Model electroweak theory, since the massless neutrino is a crucial element in this theory.\n\nResearch topic: Can the validity of the electroweak theory be restored?\n\nRemark: Further contradictions are discussed in [8]. _([Research Topics](https://oprassn.org/a-problem-in-the-electroweak-theory/))_\n```\n\n[![A Problem with the Electroweak Theory](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/79b02bf3-6e4f-427c-897b-8d58de8e4c13)](https://oprassn.org/a-problem-in-the-electroweak-theory/)\n\n```txt\nThe True Prime Pairs\n(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n\nTabulate Prime by Power of 10\nloop(10) = π(10)-π(1) = 4-0 = 4\nloop(100) = π(100)-π(10)-1th = 25-4-2 = 19\nloop(1000) = π(1000) - π(100) - 10th = 168-25-29 = 114\n\n--------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----\n True Prime Pairs → Δ→π | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9 | Sum \n==========================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+=====\n 19 → π(∆10) → π(10) | 2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | - | - | - | - | - | 4th 4 x Root\n--------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----\n 17 → π(10+∆9) → π(19) | 11 | 13 | 17 | 19 | - | - | - | - | - | 8th 4 x Twin\n==========================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+===== 1st Twin\n 13 → π(19+∆10) → π(29) | 23 | 29 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |10th\n--------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+-----\n 11 → π(29+∆12) → π(41) | 31 | 37 | 41 | - | - | - | - | - | - |13th\n==========================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+===== 1st Twin\n 7 → π(41+∆18) → π(59) | 43 | 47 | 53 | 59 | - | - | - | - | - |17th\n--------------------------+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----- 3rd Twin\n 5 → π(59+∆13) → π(72) | 61 | 67 | 71 | - | - | - | - | - | - |20th\n==========================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+===== 4th Twin\n 3,2 → 18+13+12 → 43 | 73 | 79 | 83 | 89 | 97 | 101| 103| 107| 109|29th \n==========================+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+====+=====\n Δ Δ\n12+13+(18+18)+13+12 ← 36th-Δ1=151-1=150=100+2x(13+12) ← 30th = 113 = 114-\n```\n\nHow do you resolve Maxwell equations as euler-lagrange equation without electromagnetic electromagnetism, lagrangian formalism, field theory, Maxwell equations, variational principle potential.\n\n```note\nAxial (e-e rES repulsions blue aggregating to black axial outward, vs weak axial inward) to generate the Bose “cylinder surface” proof of statistical mechanics.\n- Axial View of one hemisphere set of one subshell (N,1,many,-1/2) quantum number example below:\n- That gives the path from Planck strength to the Maxwell strengths.

These properties were chosen by Gell-Mann because they then naturally generalize the [Pauli matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_matrices) for [SU(2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SU(2)) to SU(3), which formed the basis for Gell-Mann's [quark model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark_model).[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_matrices#cite_note-2) Gell-Mann's generalization further [extends to general SU(n)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generalizations_of_Pauli_matrices#Construction).

Namely, using the dot to sum over the eight matrices and using Greek indices for their row/column indices\n- A particular choice of matrices is called a [group representation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Group_representation), because any element of SU(3) can be written in the form using the ***[Einstein notation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstein_notation)***, where the eight \n are real numbers and a sum over the index j is implied. Given one representation, an equivalent one may be obtained by an arbitrary unitary similarity transformation, since that leaves the commutator unchanged.\n- The matrices can be realized as a representation of the [infinitesimal generators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_group#The_Lie_algebra_associated_with_a_Lie_group) of the [special unitary group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group) called [SU(3)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_unitary_group#The_group_SU(3)). The [Lie algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lie_algebra) of this group (a real Lie algebra in fact) has dimension eight and therefore it has some set with eight [linearly independent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_independence) generators, which can be written as \ng_{i}, with i taking values from [1 to 8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_matrices#cite_note-Scherer-Schindler-1)\n\nThese matrices serve to study the internal (color) rotations of the ***[gluon fields](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gluon_field) associated with the coloured quarks of [quantum chromodynamics](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_chromodynamics) (cf.

The famous 3R experiment also suggests that whatever force binds the quarks together has 3 types of charge (called the 3 colors).\n- Now, into the realm of theory: we are looking for an internal symmetry having a 3-dimensional representation which can give rise to a neutral combination of 3 particles (otherwise no color-neutral baryons).\n- The simplest such statement is that a linear combination of each type of charge (red + green + blue) must be neutral, and following William of Occam we believe that the simplest theory describing all the facts must be the correct one.\n- We now postulate that the particles carrying this force, called gluons, must occur in color anti-color units (i.e. nine of them).\n- BUT, red + blue + green is neutral, which means that the linear combination red anti-red + blue anti-blue + green anti-green must be non-interacting, since otherwise the colorless baryons would be able to emit these gluons and interact with each other via the strong force—contrary to the evidence. So, there can only be ***EIGHT gluons***.\n\nThis is just Occam's razor again: a hypothetical particle that can't interact with anything, and therefore can't be detected, doesn't exist. The simplest theory describing the above is the SU(3) one with the gluons as the basis states of the Lie algebra.

We cannot see these particles since they’re so small and since they permeate all of space. They would also tunnel to a different location about once every Planck time (about 10^-43 seconds) whenever they interact with another particle.\n- These interactions between particles amount to the exchanges of bosons between electrons and other electrons or other fermions. At each point where the electron absorbs another boson, we say that the wave function of the electron collapses, and it tunnels to a new location whereupon it interacts with yet another particle.\n- The cloud of electron surrounding gravitating objects would diminish in inverse proportion to the square of the distance; hence, if you recede from an objects’ surface, you’re less likely to find an electron tunneling from that object.\n- Electrons also make an excellent candidate for a particle of gravity since they absorb and emit photons readily, and we know from Einstein’s theory of general relativity that light interacts readily with gravitational fields, and that gravitational fields are thought to emit photons spontaneously.\n- This spontaneous emission of photons is what we refer to as the cosmological constant or dark energy, and in our current thinking on the topic we imagine that particles of antimatter are created and annihilate with particles of matter leading, occasionally, to the emission of a photon. I suspect that this is incorrect and that no such thing as antimatter really exists. I suspect that positrons are really tunneling W particles and that this Dirac Sea, or background of tunneling electrons, is really giving rise to this phenomenon of the cosmological constant, or vacuum energy, we observe inn nature.\n- As a consequence, we would need to adumbrate our standard model of particle physics by about half. This ought to be seen as a positive thing in physics. No longer do we have untestable assumptions (such as the creation and annihilation of particles) in our models, and we have a far easier means of now beginning to probe the quantum nature of gravity.\n\nThe other fascinating consequence of this way of thinking is that gravity would no longer be a fundamental force; instead it would be a secondary effect of electromagnetism. This should have been what we anticipated all along; and now, we might have a quantum theory focusing on only three forces and a theory of gravitation that is truly particle-based. _([Medium - Article](https://medium.com/@cottlesam/quantum-gravity-will-force-us-to-cut-the-standard-model-in-half-c073e2033968))_\n```\n\n[![Cut the Standard Model](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/22d4a42b-da13-4a78-a3d1-e15ee5c611c6)](https://medium.com/@cottlesam/quantum-gravity-will-force-us-to-cut-the-standard-model-in-half-c073e2033968)\n\n```note\nWe may gain a better understanding of black hole physics; wewe may gain the insight that tunneling electrons enter the event horizons of black holes, absorb a particle there, and tunnel out again to deposit it into the background.

Later on, this will be corrected to include specifically quantum-style mathematics, following Feynman.\n\nThe basic rules of probability amplitudes that will be used are:\n- If an event can occur via a number of indistinguishable alternative processes (a.k.a. \"virtual\" processes), then its probability amplitude is the ***sum of the probability amplitudes of the alternatives***.\n- If a virtual process involves a number of independent or concomitant sub-processes, then the probability amplitude of the total (compound) process is the ***product of the probability amplitudes of the sub-processes***.\n\nThe indistinguishability criterion in (a) is very important: it means that there is no observable feature present in the given system that in any way \"reveals\" which alternative is taken. In such a case, one cannot observe which alternative actually takes place without changing the experimental setup in some way (e.g. by introducing a new apparatus into the system). _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics))_\n```\n\n[![First_Feynman_Diagram](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/c381a212-cf38-45db-a166-f8e8716886da)](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13930690/PhysRev.76.769.pdf)\n\n```note\nIt should be remembered that the expression hides a lot of complexity.

Similar issue is present in the usual Kaluza–Klein scenarios where one needs to provide a mechanism for _[spontaneous compactification](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#18s-structure)_. We note, however, that the situation in theory (4) is somewhat better than in the usual KK setup. In the latter case, apart from the case of compactification on S1, the pure gravity theory in 4 + D dimensions usually does not have solutions of the form of the product of Minkowski spacetime and (compact) internal manifolds. For this reason one usually extends the pure gravity theory in 4 + D dimensions with extra fields, e.g. by considering the Einstein–Yang–Mills system. The stress–energy tensor of these extra fields then allows for solutions of the required product form, see e.g. [20], Section 3. Probably the most famous compactification mechanism is that due to Freund and Rubin [21], where the 3-form field of the 11D supergravity is doing the job. In contrast, the theory (4) admits the solution that is the S3 fibration over S4, see [14] for an explicit description. Thus, at least there is a solution of (4) of the desired type without having to introduce extra fields. However, the cosmological constant for the S3 fibration over S4 solution is too large, see [14]. This is similar to the situation with the Freund–Rubin solution. Thus, a compactification mechanism that would result in an appropriately small cosmological constant is a very serious open issue for our setup. It is possible that the only way forward is to add other fields. We then remark that there is a very natural extension of the theory (4) that adds forms of all odd degrees. This is the theory that appeared in [12], formula (29). It would be interesting to study 4D compactifications of this more general theory. We hope to analyse this in the future.\n- Another open problem of the present approach is that of coupling to matter. Again, a natural way to proceed is suggested by supergravity. One does not couple supergravity to extra fields, one simply studies what the modes already present become when viewed from the 4D perspective. In particular, when compactifying on a coset manifold all modes related to isometries of the internal space are known to be important. Indeed, recall that the gauge group that arises in the KK compactification is the group of isometries of the internal manifold, and its dimension may be larger than the dimension of the internal space itself. In this paper we have considered a compactification on a group manifold, but only retained half of the relevant isometries by considering the invariant dimensional reduction ansatz. It is clear that additional fields will arise by enlarging the ansatz by taking into account all the isometries. In this case, however, one must be careful about _[the issue of consistent truncation](https://www.eq19.com/addition/#undiscovered-features)_, see e.g. [22] for a clear description of all the issues arising. We leave a study of the dimensional reduction on S3 viewed as a coset S3 = SO(4)/SO(3) to future research.\n- Third, there is a question of how to describe Lorentzian signature metrics using this formalism. To do this one must make the 3-form C complex-valued, and then impose some appropriate reality conditions. Similar issues exist in all Plebanski-related formulations. We postpone their resolution to future work.\nFinally, to avoid confusion, we would like to say that our present use of G2 structures (3-forms in 7D) is different from what one can find in the literature on Kaluza–Klein compactifications of supergravity.\n\nIn our approach a 3-form is not an object that exist in addition to the metric — it is the only object that exist. The metric, and in particular the 4D metric, is defined by the 3-forvia (2). Also, in the supergravity context a 7D manifold with a G2 structure is used for compactifying the 11D supergravity down to 4D. In contrast, we compactify from 7D to 4D. _([General relativity from three-forms in seven dimensions - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/14064088/1-s2.0-S0370269317304926-main.pdf))_\n```\n\n[![image](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/ffcf7817-4cd8-4383-8bdc-abec8d07c948)](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-8994/11/8/993)\n\nWhen describing [spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spacetime) as a continuum, certain statistical and quantum mechanical constructions are not [well-defined](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Well-defined).\n\n```note\nTo define them, or make them unambiguous, a [continuum limit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuum_limit) must carefully remove \"construction scaffolding\" of lattices at various scales.\n- Renormalization procedures are based on the requirement that certain physical quantities (such as the mass and charge of an electron) equal observed (experimental) values. That is, the experimental value of the physical quantity yields practical applications, but due to their empirical nature the observed measurement represents areas of quantum field theory that require deeper derivation from theoretical bases.\n- Renormalization was first developed in [quantum electrodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_electrodynamics) (QED) to make sense of [infinite](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinity) integrals in [perturbation theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perturbation_theory_(quantum_mechanics)).\n- Initially viewed as a suspect provisional procedure even by some of its originators, renormalization eventually was embraced as an important and [self-consistent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-consistent) actual mechanism of scale [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics) in several fields of physics and [mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics). \n\nDespite his later skepticism, it was [Paul Dirac](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Dirac) who pioneered renormalization. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization))_\n```\n\n[![image](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/c6364322-cc8c-47d2-aaad-efd2e835911f)](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms6153)\n\nNumerous connections have been observed between some, though not all, of these exceptional objects.

Exceptional objects related to the number 8 include the following.\n- The octonions are 8-dimensional. The [E8 lattice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E8_lattice) can be realized as the integral octonions (up to a scale factor).\n- The exceptional Lie groups can be seen as symmetries of the octonions and structures derived from the octonions;[[19]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exceptional_object#cite_note-19) further, the E8 algebra is related to the E8 lattice, as the notation implies (the lattice is generated by the root system of the algebra).\n- Triality occurs for Spin(8), which also connects to 8 · 3 = 24.Likewise, exceptional objects related to the number 24 include The Leech lattice is 24-dimensional.\n- Most sporadic simple groups can be related to the Leech lattice, or more broadly the Monster. The exceptional [Jordan algebra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jordan_algebra) has a representation in terms of 24×24 real matrices together with the Jordan product rule.\n- These objects are connected to various other phenomena in math which may be considered surprising but not themselves \"exceptional\". For example, in [algebraic topology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_topology), 8-fold real [Bott periodicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bott_periodicity) can be seen as coming from the octonions. In the theory of [modular forms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_forms), the 24-dimensional nature of the Leech lattice underlies the presence of 24 in the formulas for the [Dedekind eta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dedekind_eta_function) and the [modular discriminant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modular_discriminant), which connection is deepened by [Monstrous moonshine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monstrous_moonshine), a development that related modular functions to the Monster group.\n\nIn [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory) and superstring theory we often find that particular dimensions are singled out as a result of exceptional algebraic phenomena.

The resulting value (Figure 7) suggests that the quantum world is composed of an infinite number or scaled copies of our ordinary 4-dimensional space-time.\n- Setting k=0 one obtains the classical dimensions of ***heterotic superstring theory***, namely 26, 16, 10, 6 and 4, as well as the constant of super-symmetric (αgs=26) and ***non super-symmetric (αg=42) unification of all fundamental forces***.\n\nAs we have seen in section 2, the above is a Fibonacci-like sequence with a very concise geometrical interpetation related to numbers ***5, 11 and φ***. _([Phi in Particle Physics](https://www.sacred-geometry.es/?q=en/content/phi-particle-physics))_\n```\n\n[![PHI_Quantum_SpaceTime](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/6d91e9b8-9fc7-4ab9-9ec9-6e87a6f70c99)](https://www.sacred-geometry.es/?q=en/content/phi-particle-physics)\n\n```txt\n Majorana | spinors | charged | neutrinos | quark | components | parameter\n Fields | (s) | (c) | (n) | (q=s.c.n) | Σ(c+n+q | (complex)\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\nmajorana-1 | 2x2 | - | ❓ | - | ❓ | ❓\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-----------\nmajorana-2 | 2x2 | - | ❓ | - | ❓ | ❓\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-----------\nmajorana-3 | 2x2 | - | 13 ✔️ | - | 13 ✔️ | i13 ✔️\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\n Total | 12 | - | 43 | - | 43 | 30+i13\n```\n\nThe particle spectrum is completed by the Higgs particles required to give masses to fermions as well as to break the GUT symmetry.\n\n## The Metatron's Cube\n\nGeometrically, a transformation matrix rotates, stretches, or shears the vectors it acts upon.

The scalar Dark Matter case provides an interesting alternative to the usual Higgs portal scenario.\n\nWe also study the constraints from direct Dark Matter searches and the prospects for indirect detection\nvia sterile neutrino decays to leptons, which may be able to rule out Dark Matter masses below and around 100 GeV. _([Sterile Neutrino portal to Dark Matter II - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13822870/1607.02373.pdf))_\n```\n\n[![Sterile Neutrino portal to Dark Matter II](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/eff99204-e52a-4628-b3e1-07812a8df44f)](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13822870/1607.02373.pdf)\n\nIt is called the [mixing angle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weinberg_angle) by which [spontaneous symmetry breaking](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/10.html#spontaneous-symmetry-breaking) [rotates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_matrix) the original W0 and B0 [vector boson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_boson) plane, producing as a result the Z0 boson, and the [photon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photon).

The report[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton#cite_note-Abbott2017-22) did not elaborate on the source of this ratio. \n\n***It is possible that gravitons are not the quanta of gravitational waves, or that the two phenomena are related in a different way***. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton))_\n```\n\n[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/220039299-b3439ba6-8479-4a72-9521-bc12b5651e85.png)](https://theconversation.com/dark-energy-map-gives-clue-about-what-it-is-but-deepens-dispute-about-the-cosmic-expansion-rate-143200)\n\nThere even stated by the _[conformal cyclic cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology)_ that this hypothesis requires that all massive particles eventually vanish from existence.\n\n```note\nAs Penrose points out, [proton decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay) is a possibility contemplated in various speculative extensions of the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model), but it has never been observed. _Moreover, all [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron) must also decay, or lose their charge and/or mass, and no conventional speculations allow for this_.\n\nIn his Nobel Prize Lecture video, Roger Penrose moderated his previous requirement for no mass, beginning at 26:30 in the video, allowing some mass particles to be present as long as the amounts are insignificant with nearly all of their energy being kinetic, and in a conformal geometry dominated by photons. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology))_\n```\n\n[![conformal cyclic cosmology](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/8707fac0-67fe-4a17-88ef-eeff907a925d)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology)\n\nThis is because all second and third generation particles are ***unstable and quickly decay*** into stable first generation particles.\n\n```note\nThe Prime Spiral Sieve possesses remarkable structural and numeric symmetries.\n- For starters, the intervals between the prime roots (and every subsequent row or rotation of the sieve) are ***perfectly balanced***, with a period 8 difference sequence of: {6, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2}. The entire domain can thus be defined as 1 {+6 +4 +2 +4 +2 +4 +6 +2} {repeat ... ∞}.\n- As we've already suggested, the number 30 figures large in our modulo 30 domain. The Prime Spiral Sieve is Archimedean in that the separation distance between turns equals 30, ad infinitum. The first two rotations increment as follows:[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219260933-4331d79b-5815-4566-82e3-1a485bb2c61f.png)](https://primesdemystified.com/#deepsymmetries)\n- Interestingly, ***the sum of the 2nd rotation = 360***, the product of the first three primorials, 2 x 6 x 30 = 360, and when you multiply the first five [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in sequence, you produce 1, 2, 6 and 30? And, speaking of the Fibonacci number sequence, ***there is symmetry mirroring*** the above in the relationship between the terminating digits of Fibonacci numbers and their index numbers equating to members of the array populating the Prime Spiral Sieve:[![11's additive sums](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/221473004-867a1b50-f91f-470d-9922-e5e4f543a590.png)](https://primesdemystified.com/#deepsymmetries)\n- Remarkably, the sequence of ***Fibonacci terminating digits*** indexed to our domain (natural numbers not divisible by 2, 3 or 5), [13,937,179](https://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?number_id=11020) (see graphic, above), is a prime number and a member of a twin prime pair (with 13,937,177). In case you're wondering, 13,937,179 is not a reversible prime (as the reversal is a semi-prime: 9,461 x 10,271 = 97,173,931). However, given all the [repunits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repunit) that follow, we take note that ***both of the reversal's factors are congruent to 11 (mod 30 & 90)***. [Note: Repunits are abbreviated Rn, where n designates the number of unit 1's. Thus 1 is R1 and 11 is R2.]\n- Perhaps most remarkable of all, 13,937,179 when added to its reversal 97,173,931 = 111,111,110 (in strict digital root terms, the sum is 11,111,111, or R8) and the entire repeating (and palindromic) Fibo sequence end-to-end (equivalent to two rotations around the sieve) gives you this palindromic equivalency: 1,393,717,997,173,931 ≌ 11,111,111 (mod 111,111,110)... (and interestingly, 11,111,111 * 111,111,110 = 123456776543210).\n- Another point of interest: the terminating digits of the first 8 Fibonacci numbers indexed to our domain (13937179) contain two each 1's, 3's, 7's, and 9's. This is also true of the terminating digits of the first eight members of our domain (17137939).\n- Echoing the Fibonacci patterns just described, the terminating digits of the prime roots (17,137,939), when added to their reversal (93,973,171) = 111,111,110. [And note that 111,111,111 * 111,111,110 = 12345678876543210.].\n- Yet another related dimension of symmetry: The terminating digits of the prime root angles (24,264,868; see illustration of [Prime Spiral Sieve](https://primesdemystified.com/#primespiralsieve)) when added to their reversal (86,846,242) = 111,111,110, not to mention this sequence possesses symmetries that dovetail perfectly with the prime root and Fibo sequences.\n\nAnd when you combine the terminating digit symmetries described above, capturing ***three (3) rotations*** around the sieve in their actual sequences, you produce the ultimate combinatorial symmetry. _([PrimesDemystified](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/14009880/Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf))_\n```\n\n[![Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219261961-10e4d77f-ead3-43d4-9407-f01d83f1f204.png)](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/14009880/Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf)\n\nThese include generating variants of their abundance profile, assigning taxonomy and finally generating a rooted [phylogenetic tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree) for the [Standard Model](https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#three-3-layers).\n\n```note\nHere is an elegant model to define the elementary particles of the Standard Model in Physics.\n- The black spheres are the bosons, the green ones leptons and the rest of the colored ones Murray Gell-Mann’s quarks (red for Generation I, blue for II and orange for III).\n- Higgs Boson (aka the God particle) that does not have charge is the vertex between the matter and anti-matter particles.\n- The z-boson and its counterpart would lie in the centroids of the tetrahedrons created by folding the triangles to meet up at the Higgs particle.\n\nThe next step is to re-gigg the model to account for the collisions and annihilations. Gluons and Photons that don’t have mass are not in the model, but will be the consequences of the interactions. _([Hypercomplex-Math](https://nitinuchil.wordpress.com/2020/09/09/hypercomplex-math/))_\n```\n\n[![particlephysicsmodel-1](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/51ab83aa-e18d-477c-866f-d793f9efee92)](https://nitinuchil.wordpress.com/2020/09/09/hypercomplex-math/ )\n\nAll ***15 matter particles are mirroring*** their corresponding doppelgangers (anti-particles) each others that could potentially explain dark matter.\n\n## The 27 Parameters\n\nNote that since [our Universe began with a Big Bang](https://www.valdostamuseum.com/hamsmith/cosconsensus.html), all its particles originate from pair creation since then.\n\n![shilov27](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/db99b4e8-d255-49ad-b601-f061989d5209)\n\nUpon reviewing the masses, the algorithms should work correctly to depict the Generation I, II & III and the charge levels of the elementary particles.\n\n```txt\n Osp(8|4) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | th\n==========+====+====+====+=====+====\n π(10) | 2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 4th\n----------+----+----+----+-----+----\n π(19) | 11 | 13 | 17 | 19 | 8th\n----------+----+----+----+-----+----\n π(29) | 23 | 29 | - | - | 10th\n==========+====+====+====+=====+====\n π(41) | 31 | 37 | 41 | - | 13th\n----------+----+----+----+-----+----\n π(59) | 43 | 47 | 53 | 59 | 17th \n----------+----+----+----+-----+- ---\n π(72) | 61 | 67 | 71 | - | 20th\n==========+====+====+====+=====+====\n π(72+11) | 73 | 79 | 83 | - | 23th\n----------+----+----+----+-----+----\n π(83+18) | 89 | 97 |101 | - | 26th 👈\n----------+----+----+----+-----+----\n π(101+8) |103 |107 |109 | - | 29th\n```\n\nBosonic String Theory of 26-dim J3(O)o is related to an M-theory based on the full 27-dimensional J3(O) and 28-dimensional J4(Q).\n\n[![String theory](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/38b6bb71-6e4b-4020-aa59-03d83873ffc5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#Extra_dimensions)\n\nThere are models of two related universes that e.g. attempt to explain the [baryon asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry) – why there was more matter than [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter) at the beginning – [with a mirror anti-universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry#Mirror_anti-universe).\n\n```note\nIn [physical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology), the baryon asymmetry problem, also known as the matter asymmetry problem or the matter–antimatter asymmetry problem,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry#cite_note-2) is the observed imbalance in [baryonic matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryonic_matter) (the type of matter experienced in everyday life) and [antibaryonic matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibaryonic_matter) in the [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe).\n- Neither the [standard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics) nor the theory of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) provides a known explanation for why this should be so, and it is a natural assumption that the universe is neutral with all conserved [charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics)).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry#cite_note-3)\n- The [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang) should have produced equal amounts of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter) and [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter).

The A4HTM is a four-Higgs- Triplet-Model (δ of 1 and (∆x, ∆y, ∆z) of 3).\n- Four mass eigenstates of [doubly charged](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/13276480_Higgs_triplets_in_the_standard_model) Higgs bosons, H±±i, are obtained explicitly from the Higgs potential.\n- We also obtained four mass eigenstates of the triplet-like singly charged Higgs bosons, H±T i, for which doublet components can be ignored because of small triplet vev’s.\n- It was shown that the A4HTM gives unique predictions about their decay branching ratios into two leptons (H−−i → ℓℓ′ and H−iT → ℓν); for example, the leptonic decays of H−−2 are only into µµ and eτ because an approximate Z3 symmetry remains, and the ratio of the branching ratios is 2 : 1 as a consequence of the A4 symmetry in the original Lagrangian.\n- Therefore, it will be possible to test the model at hadron colliders (Tevatron and LHC) if some of these Higgs bosons are light enough to be produced.\n- Even if these Higgs bosons are too heavy to be produced at hadron colliders, they can affect the lepton flavor violating decays of charged leptons if the triplet Yukawa coupling constants are large enough.\n- It was shown that there is no contribution of these Higgs bosonsto µ → eee ¯ and ℓ → ℓ′γ.\n- Thus, we can naturally expect signals of τ → µee and τ → eµµ(which are possible in this model among six τ → ℓℓ′ℓ′′) in the future in collider experiments (Super-KEKB, super B factory, super flavor factory, and LHCb) without interfering with a stringent experimental bound on µ → eee ¯ .

The light SU(2)L triplet Higgs required by the gauge coupling unification can be realized consistently within the framework of SU(5) grand unified theory (see Appendix B).\n- This complex triplet Higgs contains one CP-even Heavy Higgs, one CP-odd Higgs and two charged Higgs bosons, which could be the smoking gun single of this scenario.\n- Although the unification scale around 1014 GeV is too low, in the usual sense, leading to significant proton decay constraints, we have shown that the constrains can be avoided by introducing additional vector-like fermions which mix with the SM fermions through an SU(5) breaking mass term.\n- Importantly, the minimal requirement is quite simple and only requires the addition of a single pair of 10 and 10 fermions to mix with the first generation 10 matter multiplet.\n- To get enough suppression in the proton decay rate, the SU(2)L singlet quark should have significant mixing with the vector-like fermion while SU(2) doublet quark should have almost zero mixing with it (or vice versa).\n- Interestingly, this leads to a suppression in the proton decay mediated by X gauge bosons but leads to a significant enhancement in the proton decay through the colored Higgs boson. This means that if nature is realized by this minimal model, it is bound to show up in proton decay experiments eventually.\n- Although this model has some additional fine tuning, the fine-tuning of the fermion masses is similar in nature to the doublet-triplet splitting present in all GUT models. \n\nSince the fine-tuning for all the fields in our model, including the light complex SU(2)L triplet, are similar in design to the doublet-triplet splitting, it is possible that all the required tuning of this GUT theory is solved by a single lmechanism, e.g. product group unification scenarios. _([W boson mass anomaly and grand unification - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/14412652/2205.03877.pdf))_\n```\n\n***the 12 fermions and 5 bosons are known to have 48 and 13 variations, respectively***\n\n```txt\n Fermion | spinors | charged | neutrinos | quark | components | parameter\n Field | (s) | (c) | (n) | (q=s.c.n) | Σ(c+n+q | (complex)\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\nbispinor-1 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 18 | 24 | 19\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-- 17\nbispinor-2 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 18 | 24 | i12 ✔️\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\nbispinor-3 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 18 | 24 | 11\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-- 19\nbispinor-4 | 2 | 3 | 3 | 18 | 24 | i18 ✔️\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\n SubTotal | 8 | 12 | 12 | 72 | 96 | 66+i30\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\nmajorana-1 | 2x2 | - | 18 | - | 18 | 18 ✔️\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-----------\nmajorana-2 | 2x2 | - | 12 | - | 12 | 12 ✔️\n-----------+---------+---------+-----------+-----------+------------+-----------\nmajorana-3 | 2x2 | - | 13 | - | 13 | i13\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\n SubTotal | 12 | - | 43 | - | 43 | 30+i13\n===========+=========+=========+===========+===========+============+===========\n Total | 20 | 12 | 55 | 72 | 139 | 96+i43 ✔️\n```\n\nSince the total of parameters is ***66+i30*** then according to _[renormalization theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalization)_ the 12 boson fields should have the total complex value of ***30+i66***.\n\n## Beyond the 139\n\nSimilarly the Standard Model incorporates three generations of quarks, so its fermionic content can be summarized. \n\n```note\nIn addition, the Standard Model involves gauge bosons (photons for the electromagnetic interaction, W and Z for the weak interaction, and ***eight (8) gluons*** for the strong interaction), plus the (scalar) Higgs particle.

This is on account of the overwhelmingly large background contribution from a number of other SM processes that can mimic its experimental signature characterized by the appearance of a bottom and an anti-bottom quark.\n\nThe CMS Collaboration overcame this challenge by deploying modern sophisticated analysis tools and by focusing on particular signatures where a Higgs boson is produced in association with a vector boson V (a W or Z particle), a weak interaction process known as VH(bb), shown in the figure below, leading to a significant reduction in the background. _([CERN](https://cms.cern/news/higgs-observed-decaying-b-quarks))_\n```\n\n[![down-type quark](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/36b73f3c-fc47-428e-9d90-7f6f1c1e361a)](https://cms.cern/news/higgs-observed-decaying-b-quarks)\n\nStudy of connections between neutrino phenomenology and leptogenesis shows the patterns of symmetry breaking from SO10 to the Standard Model gauge group.\n\n```note\nSince right-handed neutrinos appear naturally in the grand unified model based on the group SO(10) [5], it is of interest to discuss leptogenesis under the constraints suggested by such a model.\n- It turns out, however, that such constraints render a successful leptogenesis extremely difficult to obtain.\n- This happens because, unless a fine tuning on the neutrino mass parameters is introduced, the right-handed neutrinos become very hierarchical in mass, with the lowest mass being too small to allow for leptogenesis. \n\nA compactness in the right-handed neutrino mass spectrum is, however, able to overcome this difficulty and achieve a consistent leptogenesis. _([Neutrino Phenomenology and Leptogenesis - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/14967913/2698_FiorilloDFG_21-06-2018.pdf))_\n```\n\n[![Patterns-of-symmetry-breaking-from-SO10-to-the-Standard-Model-gauge-group](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/fc850392-b83d-459d-9769-094843d447aa)](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/14967913/2698_FiorilloDFG_21-06-2018.pdf)\n\nWe have found that if the intermediate scales induced by the soft SUSY breaking sector the model ***contains three families*** of vector-like leptons within the reach of LHC measurements or future High-Energy/High-Luminosity LHC upgrades. \n\n```note\nOur framework features the minimum of three (and maximum of five) light Higgs doublets at the electroweak scale providing a Cabibbo mixing consistent with the top-charm and bottom-strange mass hierarchies as well as massless first-generation quarks at tree-level. _([Prospects for new physics](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-08710-4))_\n```\n\n[![10052_2020_8710_Fig1_HTML](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/220b1111-2b0e-454a-a56f-602de2a84afc)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1140/epjc/s10052-020-08710-4)\n\nThe inclusion of one-loop corrections with mild hierarchies supply the necessary ingredients to potentially generate realistic quark masses and mixing angles. \n\n```note\nThe present particle physics or standard model based on the \"unreal gauge transformation symmetry\" and meaningless math cannot explain any actual physical mechanism at all _([biglobe.ne.jp](https://www7b.biglobe.ne.jp/~kcy05t/parph.html))_\n```\n\n[![hsta1](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/f351b6d2-753a-45e4-8e26-f06a822db06f)](https://www7b.biglobe.ne.jp/~kcy05t/parph.html)\n\nThus it appears that the [cosmological models](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7897631/#RSPA20200786C24) derived from compactification of 11d supergravity on a manifold with [G2 holonomy](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7897631/) have some ***[hidden E7 symmetry](https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#the-seven-7-groups).***\n\n## The 77 Principles\n\nUsing this concept we are going to stimulate a model of [the 11 dimensions](https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#the-11-dimensions) through the rank of their partition using github organizations of 13 repositories each.\n\n```tip\nEach of the user profiles will have ***seven (7) user repositories*** consist of one (1) main of [`github.io`](https://docs.github.com/en/pages/setting-up-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll/creating-a-github-pages-site-with-jekyll) and six (6) user pinned repositories.

Thus the 16 plet has the decomposition in SU(5) ⊗ U(1) so that 16 =10(−1) ⊕ 5(3) ⊕ 1(−5).\n- As noted the combination 5 ⊕ 10 in SU(5) is anomaly free and further 1(−5) in the 16-plet decomposition is a right handed neutrino which is a singlet of the standard model gauge group and thus the 16-plet of matter in SO(10) is anomaly free.\n- The absence of anomaly in this case is the consequence of a more general result for SO(N) gauge theories. Thus in general anomalies arise due to the non-vanishing of the trace over the product of three group generators in some given group representation Tr ({Ta, Tb}Tc).\n- For SO(10) one will have Tr ({Σµν, Σαβ}Σλρ). However, there is no invariant tensor to which the above quantity can be proportional which then automatically guarantees vanishing of the anomaly for SO(10). This analysis extends to other SO(N) groups.\n- ***One exception is SO(6) where there does exist a six index invariant tensor*** ǫµναβλρ and so in this case vanishing of the anomaly is not automatic.\n- The group SO(10) is rank 5 where as the standard model gauge group is rank 4. The rank of the group can be reduced by either using ***16 ⊕ 16 of Higgs fields or 126 ⊕ 126 of Higgs***.\n- Since under SU(5) ⊗ U(1) one has 16 ⊃ 1(−5) we see that a VEV formation for the singlet will reduce the rank of the group. Similarly 126 ⊃ 1(−10) under the above decomposition. Thus when the singlets in 16 ⊕ 16 of Higgs or 126 ⊕ 126 get VEVs, the SO(10) gauge symmetry will break reducing its rank.\n- However, we still need to reduce the remaining group symmetry to the Standard Model gauge group. For this we need to have additional Higgs fields such as 45, 54, 210. Further to get the residual gauge group SU(3)C ⊗ U(1)em we need to have 10 -plet of Higgs fields.\n- Thus the breaking of SO(10) down to SU(3)C ⊗ U(1)em ***requires at least three (3) sets of Higgs representations***: one to reduce the rank, the second to break the rest of the gauge group to the Standard Model gauge group and then at least one 10-plet to break the electroweak symmetry.[![Higgs fields](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/ac0b2608-24b2-4a0d-bae8-55473a8576d9)](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-022-04892-x)\n- As discussed above one can do this by a combination of fields from the set: 10, 16 ⊕ 16, 45, 54, 120, 126 ⊕ 126, 210.\n- To generate quark and lepton masses we need to couple two 16-plets of matter with Higgs fields. ***To see which Higgs fields couple we expand the product 16⊗16 as a sum over the irreducible representations of SO(10)***. \n\nHere we have ***16 ⊗ 16 = 10s ⊕ 120a ⊕ 126s***, where the s(a) refer to symmetric (anti-symmetric) under the interchange of the two 16-plets.

The 7 split octonions are identified by selecting a triad.\n- The complement of {1,2,3,4,5,6,7} and the triad list leaves 4 elements which are the rows/colums corresponding to the negated elements in the multiplication table (highlighted with yellow background).\n- The red arrows in the Fano Plane indicate the potential reversal due to this negation that defines the split octonions. The selected triad nodes are yellow, and the other 4 are cyan (25MB).\n- These allow for the simplification of Maxwell’s four equations which define electromagnetism (aka.light) into a single equation.\n\nBelow is the first page of the comprehensive split octonion list of all 3840 Split Fano Planes with their multiplication tables available. _([8×16×30 Split Fano](https://theoryofeverything.org/theToE/2013/06/22/the-comprehensive-split-octonions-and-their-fano-planes/))_\n```\n\n[![splitFano1](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/ad09e553-bdb2-4a8b-a310-428ad1c52d92)](https://theoryofeverything.org/theToE/2013/06/22/the-comprehensive-split-octonions-and-their-fano-planes/)\n\nThe split real even E8 group used has been determined from Dynkin diagram which builds the Cartan matrix and determines the root with corresponding Hasse diagrams.\n\n```note\nThe breaking chains of SO(10) to G SM are shown along with their terrestrial and cosmological signatures, where G x represents either G 3221 or G 421 .

Even more annoyingly, both quantum mechanics and relativity are very solidly proven to be true.\n- Cosmologists found dark matter and then dark energy. They can describe their observed properties - point out that about 96% of everything is dark matter/energy - and then leave particle physicists with a major problem.\n- The demands of theoreticians for more data has pushed particle colliders to somewhere ***close to the limits of our ability*** to pay for the darned things (although not yet the limits of theoretical feasibility).\n- The construction of something significantly bigger than the Large Hadron Collider does not seem likely right now so the data we have may turn out to be the only data we’ll ever have (from particle colliders). Large space telescopes, however, are getting MUCH better and when SpaceX get their StarShip to fly - they’ll be much cheaper and MUCH larger. So getting help from cosmologists MIGHT offer assistance.\n- The great hope that String Theory could be the “Theory of Everything” has somewhat tarnished. The last “Superstring revolution” was impressive but it was close to 30 years ago now and we still don’t seem to be adopting it as The Truth.\n- String theory predicts that one out of 10⁵ possible realities is the one we live in but fails to mention which one! This is not exactly useful!\n- Current string theories seem ***incompatible with dark energy*** - which is definitely not good.\n\nThere is an additional problem called ***Background Independence*** - which is a property that Relativity requires - but which string theory does not seem to reproduce… but this is still a matter of contention.

The [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) of a [particle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elementary_particle) may be used to define a handedness, or helicity, for that particle, which, in the case of a massless particle, is the same as chirality. A [symmetry transformation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symmetry_transformation) between the two is called [parity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parity_(physics)) transformation. Invariance under parity transformation by a [Dirac fermion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_fermion) is called chiral symmetry.\n- For massless particles – photons, gluons, and (hypothetical) gravitons – chirality is the same as helicity; a given massless particle appears to [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) in the same direction along its axis of motion regardless of point of view of the observer.\n- For massive particles – such as electrons, quarks, and neutrinos – chirality and helicity must be distinguished: In the case of these particles, it is possible for an observer to change to a reference frame moving faster than the spinning particle, in which case the particle will then appear to move backwards, and its helicity (which may be thought of as \"apparent chirality\") will be reversed. That is, helicity is a constant of motion, but it is not Lorentz invariant. Chirality is Lorentz invariant, but is not a constant of motion: a massive left-handed spinor, when propagating, will evolve into a right handed spinor over time, and vice versa.\n- A massless particle moves with the speed of light, so no real observer (who must always travel at less than the speed of light) can be in any reference frame where the particle appears to reverse its relative direction of spin, meaning that all real observers see the same helicity. Because of this, the direction of spin of massless particles is not affected by a change of inertial reference frame (a Lorentz boost) in the direction of motion of the particle, and the sign of the projection (helicity) is fixed for all reference frames: The helicity of massless particles is a relativistic invariant (a quantity whose value is the same in all inertial reference frames) which always matches the massless particle's chirality.\n\nThe discovery of neutrino oscillation implies that neutrinos have mass, so the photon is the only confirmed massless particle; gluons are expected to also be massless, although this has not been conclusively tested.[b] Hence, these are the only two particles now known for which helicity could be identical to chirality, and only the photon has been confirmed by measurement.

It is negative (\"left-handed\") if the directions of spin and motion are opposite. So a standard [clock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock), with its spin vector defined by the rotation of its hands, has left-handed helicity if tossed with its face directed forwards.\n- Mathematically, helicity is the sign of the projection of the [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)) [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric)) onto the [momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Momentum) [vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vector_(geometric)): ***\"left\" is negative, \"right\" is positive.\nhave mass and thus may have different helicities in different reference frames***.\n- Chiral theories: Particle physicists have only observed or inferred left-chiral fermions and right-chiral antifermions engaging in the charged weak interaction.[1] In the case of the weak interaction, which can in principle engage with both left- and right-chiral fermions, only two left-handed fermions interact. Interactions involving right-handed or opposite-handed fermions have not been shown to occur, ***implying that the universe has a preference for left-handed chirality***. This preferential treatment of one chiral realization over another violates parity, as first noted by Chien Shiung Wu in her famous experiment known as the Wu experiment. This is a striking observation, since parity is a symmetry that holds for all other fundamental interactions.\n- Chirality for a Dirac fermion ψ is defined through the operator γ5, which has eigenvalues ±1; the eigenvalue's sign is equal to the particle's chirality: +1 for right-handed, −1 for left-handed. Any Dirac field can thus be projected into its ***left- or right-handed*** component by acting with the projection operators.[![Right_left_helicity svg](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/6a9a0f44-a1ed-41e5-878f-62948c19d9de)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Left-right_model)\n- The coupling of the charged weak interaction to fermions is proportional to the first projection operator, which is responsible for this interaction's parity symmetry violation.\n- A common source of confusion is due to conflating the γ5, chirality operator with the helicity operator. Since the helicity of massive particles is frame-dependent, it might seem that the same particle would interact with the weak force according to one frame of reference, but not another. The resolution to this paradox is that the chirality operator is equivalent to helicity for massless fields only, for which helicity is not frame-dependent. By contrast, for massive particles, chirality is not the same as helicity, or, alternatively, helicity is not Lorentz invariant, so there is no frame dependence of the weak interaction: a particle that couples to the weak force in one frame does so in every frame.\n- A theory that is asymmetric with respect to chiralities is called a chiral theory, while a non-chiral (i.e., parity-symmetric) theory is sometimes called a vector theory. Many pieces of the Standard Model of physics are non-chiral, which is traceable to anomaly cancellation in chiral theories. Quantum chromodynamics is an example of a vector theory, since both chiralities of all quarks appear in the theory, and couple to gluons in the same way.\n- ***The electroweak theory, developed in the mid 20th century, is an example of a chiral theory***. Originally, it assumed that neutrinos were massless, and assumed the existence of only left-handed neutrinos and right-handed antineutrinos. After the observation of neutrino oscillations, which imply that neutrinos are massive (like all other fermions) the revised theories of the electroweak interaction now include both right- and left-handed neutrinos. However, it is still a chiral theory, as it does not respect parity symmetry.\n- The exact nature of the neutrino is still unsettled and so the electroweak theories that have been proposed are somewhat different, but most accommodate the chirality of neutrinos in the same way as was already done for all other fermions.\n\nBy Chiral symmetry the Vector gauge theories with massless Dirac fermion fields ψ exhibit chiral symmetry, i.e., rotating the left-handed and the right-handed components independently makes no difference to the theory. We can write this as the action of rotation on the fields:\n```\n\n![Symmetry State](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/70cb2eb0-0955-4d18-8400-e05ac1b9d325)\n\nThe Standard Model with massive neutrinos need ***7 more parameters*** (3 [CKM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cabibbo%E2%80%93Kobayashi%E2%80%93Maskawa_matrix) and 4 [PMNS matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PMNS_matrix) parameters) for a total of _[26 parameters](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/15.html#parity-order)_.

A comparison between the salient features of quark and lepton flavor mixing structures is also made.\n- The SM contains thirteen free flavor parameters in its electroweak sector: three charged-lepton masses,\nsix quark masses, three quark flavor mixing angles and one CP-violating phase.\n- Since the three neutrinos must be massive beyond the SM, one has to introduce seven (or nine) extra free parameters to describe their flavor properties: three neutrino masses, three lepton flavor mixing angles and one (or three) CP-violating phase(s), corresponding to their Dirac (or Majorana) nature a\n- The ***3x3 lepton vs quark mixing matrices*** appearing in the weak charged-current interactions are referred to, respectively, as the ***Pontecorvo-Maki-Nakagawa-Sakata (PMNS)*** matrix Uand the ***Cabibbo-Kobayashi-Maskawa (CKM)*** matrix V which all the fermion fields are the mass eigenstates.\n- By convention, U and V are defined to be associated with W− and W+, respectively. Note that V is unitary as dictated by the SM itself, but whether U is unitary or not depends on the mechanism responsible for the origin of neutrino masses.\n- The charged leptons and quarks with the same electriccharges all have the normal mass hierarchies (namely, me ≪ mµ ≪ mτ, mu ≪ mc ≪ mt and md ≪ ms ≪ m. Yet it remains unclear whether the three neutrinos also have a normal mass ordering (m1 < m2 < m3) or not. Now that m1 < m2 has been fixed from the solar neutrino oscillations, ***the only likely “abnormal” mass ordering is m3 < m1 < m2***\n- The neutrino mass ordering is one of the central concerns in flavor physics, and it will be determined in the foreseeable future with the help of either an accelerator-based neutrino oscillation experiment or a reactor-based antineutrino oscillation experiment, or both of them. Up to now the moduli of nine elements of the CKM matrix V have been determined from current experimental data to a good degree of accuracy.\n\nHere our focus is on the ***five (5) parameters*** of strong and weak CP violation. In the quark sector, the strong CP-violating phase θ remains unknown, but the weak CP-violating phase δq has been determined to a good degree of accuracy.

The report[[22]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton#cite_note-Abbott2017-22) did not elaborate on the source of this ratio. \n\n***It is possible that gravitons are not the quanta of gravitational waves, or that the two phenomena are related in a different way***. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton))_\n```\n\n[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/220039299-b3439ba6-8479-4a72-9521-bc12b5651e85.png)](https://theconversation.com/dark-energy-map-gives-clue-about-what-it-is-but-deepens-dispute-about-the-cosmic-expansion-rate-143200)\n\nThere even stated by the _[conformal cyclic cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology)_ that this hypothesis requires that all massive particles eventually vanish from existence.\n\n```note\nAs Penrose points out, [proton decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proton_decay) is a possibility contemplated in various speculative extensions of the [Standard Model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model), but it has never been observed. _Moreover, all [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron) must also decay, or lose their charge and/or mass, and no conventional speculations allow for this_.\n\nIn his Nobel Prize Lecture video, Roger Penrose moderated his previous requirement for no mass, beginning at 26:30 in the video, allowing some mass particles to be present as long as the amounts are insignificant with nearly all of their energy being kinetic, and in a conformal geometry dominated by photons. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology))_\n```\n\n[![conformal cyclic cosmology](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/8707fac0-67fe-4a17-88ef-eeff907a925d)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conformal_cyclic_cosmology)\n\nThis is because all second and third generation particles are ***unstable and quickly decay*** into stable first generation particles.\n\n```note\nThe Prime Spiral Sieve possesses remarkable structural and numeric symmetries.\n- For starters, the intervals between the prime roots (and every subsequent row or rotation of the sieve) are ***perfectly balanced***, with a period 8 difference sequence of: {6, 4, 2, 4, 2, 4, 6, 2}. The entire domain can thus be defined as 1 {+6 +4 +2 +4 +2 +4 +6 +2} {repeat ... ∞}.\n- As we've already suggested, the number 30 figures large in our modulo 30 domain. The Prime Spiral Sieve is Archimedean in that the separation distance between turns equals 30, ad infinitum. The first two rotations increment as follows:[![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219260933-4331d79b-5815-4566-82e3-1a485bb2c61f.png)](https://primesdemystified.com/#deepsymmetries)\n- Interestingly, ***the sum of the 2nd rotation = 360***, the product of the first three primorials, 2 x 6 x 30 = 360, and when you multiply the first five [Fibonacci numbers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibonacci_number) in sequence, you produce 1, 2, 6 and 30? And, speaking of the Fibonacci number sequence, ***there is symmetry mirroring*** the above in the relationship between the terminating digits of Fibonacci numbers and their index numbers equating to members of the array populating the Prime Spiral Sieve:[![11's additive sums](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/221473004-867a1b50-f91f-470d-9922-e5e4f543a590.png)](https://primesdemystified.com/#deepsymmetries)\n- Remarkably, the sequence of ***Fibonacci terminating digits*** indexed to our domain (natural numbers not divisible by 2, 3 or 5), [13,937,179](https://primes.utm.edu/curios/page.php?number_id=11020) (see graphic, above), is a prime number and a member of a twin prime pair (with 13,937,177). In case you're wondering, 13,937,179 is not a reversible prime (as the reversal is a semi-prime: 9,461 x 10,271 = 97,173,931). However, given all the [repunits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Repunit) that follow, we take note that ***both of the reversal's factors are congruent to 11 (mod 30 & 90)***. [Note: Repunits are abbreviated Rn, where n designates the number of unit 1's. Thus 1 is R1 and 11 is R2.]\n- Perhaps most remarkable of all, 13,937,179 when added to its reversal 97,173,931 = 111,111,110 (in strict digital root terms, the sum is 11,111,111, or R8) and the entire repeating (and palindromic) Fibo sequence end-to-end (equivalent to two rotations around the sieve) gives you this palindromic equivalency: 1,393,717,997,173,931 ≌ 11,111,111 (mod 111,111,110)... (and interestingly, 11,111,111 * 111,111,110 = 123456776543210).\n- Another point of interest: the terminating digits of the first 8 Fibonacci numbers indexed to our domain (13937179) contain two each 1's, 3's, 7's, and 9's. This is also true of the terminating digits of the first eight members of our domain (17137939).\n- Echoing the Fibonacci patterns just described, the terminating digits of the prime roots (17,137,939), when added to their reversal (93,973,171) = 111,111,110. [And note that 111,111,111 * 111,111,110 = 12345678876543210.].\n- Yet another related dimension of symmetry: The terminating digits of the prime root angles (24,264,868; see illustration of [Prime Spiral Sieve](https://primesdemystified.com/#primespiralsieve)) when added to their reversal (86,846,242) = 111,111,110, not to mention this sequence possesses symmetries that dovetail perfectly with the prime root and Fibo sequences.\n\nAnd when you combine the terminating digit symmetries described above, capturing ***three (3) rotations*** around the sieve in their actual sequences, you produce the ultimate combinatorial symmetry. _([PrimesDemystified](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/14009880/Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf))_\n```\n\n[![Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/219261961-10e4d77f-ead3-43d4-9407-f01d83f1f204.png)](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/14009880/Prime-Numbers-Demystified-by-8-Dimensional-Algorithms.pdf)\n\nThese include generating variants of their abundance profile, assigning taxonomy and finally generating a rooted [phylogenetic tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phylogenetic_tree) for the [Standard Model](https://www.eq19.com/identition/span12/#three-3-layers).\n\n```note\nHere is an elegant model to define the elementary particles of the Standard Model in Physics.\n- The black spheres are the bosons, the green ones leptons and the rest of the colored ones Murray Gell-Mann’s quarks (red for Generation I, blue for II and orange for III).\n- Higgs Boson (aka the God particle) that does not have charge is the vertex between the matter and anti-matter particles.\n- The z-boson and its counterpart would lie in the centroids of the tetrahedrons created by folding the triangles to meet up at the Higgs particle.\n\nThe next step is to re-gigg the model to account for the collisions and annihilations. Gluons and Photons that don’t have mass are not in the model, but will be the consequences of the interactions. _([Hypercomplex-Math](https://nitinuchil.wordpress.com/2020/09/09/hypercomplex-math/))_\n```\n\n[![particlephysicsmodel-1](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/51ab83aa-e18d-477c-866f-d793f9efee92)](https://nitinuchil.wordpress.com/2020/09/09/hypercomplex-math/ )\n\nAll ***15 matter particles are mirroring*** their corresponding doppelgangers (anti-particles) each others that could potentially explain dark matter.\n\n## The 27 Parameters\n\nNote that since [our Universe began with a Big Bang](https://www.valdostamuseum.com/hamsmith/cosconsensus.html), all its particles originate from pair creation since then.\n\n![shilov27](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/db99b4e8-d255-49ad-b601-f061989d5209)\n\nUpon reviewing the masses, the algorithms should work correctly to depict the Generation I, II & III and the charge levels of the elementary particles.\n\n```txt\n Osp(8|4) | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | th\n==========+====+====+====+=====+====\n π(10) | 2 | 3 | 5 | 7 | 4th\n----------+----+----+----+-----+----\n π(19) | 11 | 13 | 17 | 19 | 8th\n----------+----+----+----+-----+----\n π(29) | 23 | 29 | - | - | 10th\n==========+====+====+====+=====+====\n π(41) | 31 | 37 | 41 | - | 13th\n----------+----+----+----+-----+----\n π(59) | 43 | 47 | 53 | 59 | 17th \n----------+----+----+----+-----+- ---\n π(72) | 61 | 67 | 71 | - | 20th\n==========+====+====+====+=====+====\n π(72+11) | 73 | 79 | 83 | - | 23th\n----------+----+----+----+-----+----\n π(83+18) | 89 | 97 |101 | - | 26th 👈\n----------+----+----+----+-----+----\n π(101+8) |103 |107 |109 | - | 29th\n```\n\nBosonic String Theory of 26-dim J3(O)o is related to an M-theory based on the full 27-dimensional J3(O) and 28-dimensional J4(Q).\n\n[![String theory](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/38b6bb71-6e4b-4020-aa59-03d83873ffc5)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory#Extra_dimensions)\n\nThere are models of two related universes that e.g. attempt to explain the [baryon asymmetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry) – why there was more matter than [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter) at the beginning – [with a mirror anti-universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry#Mirror_anti-universe).\n\n```note\nIn [physical cosmology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_cosmology), the baryon asymmetry problem, also known as the matter asymmetry problem or the matter–antimatter asymmetry problem,[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry#cite_note-1)[[2]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry#cite_note-2) is the observed imbalance in [baryonic matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryonic_matter) (the type of matter experienced in everyday life) and [antibaryonic matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antibaryonic_matter) in the [observable universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe).\n- Neither the [standard model](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_Model) of [particle physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_physics) nor the theory of [general relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_relativity) provides a known explanation for why this should be so, and it is a natural assumption that the universe is neutral with all conserved [charges](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics)).[[3]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baryon_asymmetry#cite_note-3)\n- The [Big Bang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Bang) should have produced equal amounts of [matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter) and [antimatter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter).

The others are experimental, meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an experiment to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail.\n\nMany of these problems apply to LQG, including:\n\n- Can quantum mechanics and general relativity be realized as a fully consistent theory (perhaps as a quantum field theory)?\n- Is spacetime fundamentally continuous or discrete?\n- Would a consistent theory involve a force mediated by a hypothetical graviton, or be a product of a discrete structure of spacetime itself (as in loop quantum gravity)?\n- Are there deviations from the predictions of general relativity at very small or very large scales or in other extreme circumstances that flow from a quantum gravity theory?\n\nThe theory of LQG is one possible solution to the problem of quantum gravity, as is [string theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory). There are substantial differences however. For example, string theory also addresses [unification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unified_field_theory), the understanding of all known forces and particles as manifestations of a single entity, by postulating extra dimensions and so-far unobserved additional particles and symmetries.

They found many wonderful things.\n- For one, a CPT-respecting ***universe naturally expands and fills itself with particles, without the need for a long-theorized period of rapid expansion known as inflation***. While there's a lot of evidence that an event like inflation occurred, the theoretical picture of that event is incredibly fuzzy. It's so fuzzy that there is plenty of room for proposals of viable alternatives.\n- Second, a CPT-respecting universe would add some additional neutrinos to the mix. There are three known neutrino flavors: the electron-neutrino, muon-neutrino and tau-neutrino. ***Strangely, all three of these neutrino flavors are left-handed*** (referring to the direction of its spin relative to its motion). All other particles known to physics have both left- and right-handed varieties, so physicists have long wondered if there are additional right-handed neutrinos.\n- A CPT-respecting universe would demand the existence of ***at least one right-handed neutrino species***. This species would be largely invisible to physics experiments, only ever influencing the rest of the universe through gravity. But an invisible particle that floods the universe and only interacts via gravity sounds a lot like dark matter.\n\nThe researchers found that the conditions imposed by obeying CPT symmetry would fill our universe with right-handed neutrinos, enough to account for the dark matter. _([LiveScience](https://www.livescience.com/mirror-universe-explains-dark-matter))_\n```\n\n***1 instance + 7 blocks + 29 flats + 77 rooms = 37+77 = 114 objects***\n\n```txt\nTrue Prime Pairs:\n(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n\n | 168 | 618 |\n-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ -----------------------------------------------\n{786}| 1,2 | 2 | 2,3 | 3,4 | {19} |\n-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |\n {86}| 4 | 4,5 | 5,6 |{6,7}| 17 Base Zone\n +-----+-----+-----+-----+ |\n {78}|{7,8}| 8,9 | 12 (M & F) ----> Δ |\n +-----+-----+-----+ <-------- Mirror Zone (Middle zero axis) -----------\n {67}| 9,11|11,12|12,14| 11 |\n ----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |\n {6}|15,16|17,18|18,20|21,22| 19 Extended Zone\n +-----+-----+-----+-----+ |\n {8}|23,25|25,27|27,29| 18 |\n +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+ -----------\n {7}|29,33|33,36|36,39|39,41|41,45|46,51|51,57|58,66|{67,77}| 43 (C1 & C2)<---Δ\n-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-------+ -----------\n | 1 2 3 | 4 5 6 | 7 8 9 |\n |------ 29' ------|--------------- 139' ----------------|\n |------ 618¨ -----|--------------- 168¨ ----------------| ✔️\n```\n\nThis _[77 principles](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#the-77-principles)_ have worked so well on simple examples such as water molecules that we can be reasonably confident they will work for more complex examples.\n\n```note\nMEC 30 claims to \"illustrate and convey the connections between quantum mechanics, gravitation and mathematics in a new way\" via the elementary level of numbers.\n\n**Why does it work?**\n\n- It starts with a theory about the structure of light, which is then transferred to various areas of the natural sciences.\n- In the subatomic space, Heisenberger does not allow precise measurements because the measurements themselves distort the result.\n- Through the mathematical basis presented here, our scale behaves like _[Plank's quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck%27s_law)_ of action and shows in the positions the behaviorally entangled photons, which in turn produce the quantum of action in the sums. \n- The MEC 30 as a folding rule is also here a tool for _[The Entangled Quantum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_entanglement)_ systems to explain the ghostly behavior of _[the elementary particles](https://www.eq19.com/exponentiation/#elementary-particles)_.\n- It would also to make the underlying algorithm visible and explainable, keyword quantum teleportation.

So it can’t be observed or identified on the scale of subatomic particles.\n- However, [gravity](https://byjus.com/physics/gravity/) is ***very dominant in long-distance scenarios***. It controls the structure of the macro universe (galaxies, planets, stars, moons).\n- As far as quantum mechanics is concerned, gravity doesn’t have much effect. The probable nature of the quantum realm also poses a significant challenge for the induction of gravity in the quantum realm.\n- Generally, ***gravity does not act as a particle as its own***. Even if a hypothetical model is introduced to explain the particle nature of a gravity particle, it violates fundamental energy laws.\n\nIn the 1970s, theorists tried to discard the self-destructive idea of point-like gravity particles. Instead of point particles, strings were introduced. Even if strings collide, there will be no infinite energy problem. Strings can smoothly smash and rebound without implying any physically nonsense infinities.\n```\n\n[![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/284033450-8984a822-b65c-4522-84cf-67f1a0d335c5.png)](https://byjus.com/physics/stringtheory/)\n\nYou can attach a persistent disk or create an instance with [Local SSDs](https://cloud.google.com/compute/docs/disks/add-persistent-disk#formatting) when using Container-Optimized OS.

These are based on symmetries of toroidally reduced supergravity; however are defined on a general background.\n- From the point of view of ExFT the toroidal background is a maximally symmetric solution preserving all U-duality symmetries. In this sense the approach is similar to the embedding tensor technique, which is used to define gauge supergravity in a covariant and supersymmetry invariant form. Although any particular choice of gauging breaks certain amount of supersymmetry, the formalism itself is completely invariant. Similarly the U-duality covariant approach is transferred to dynamics of branes in both string and M-theory, whose construction has not been covered here.\n- In the text, we described construction of the field content of exceptional field theories from fields of dimensionally reduced 11-dimensional supergravity, and local and global symmetries of the theories. Various solutions of the section constraint giving Type IIA/B, 11D and lower-dimensional gauged supergravities have been discussed without going deep into technical details. For readers’ convenience references for the original works are present.\n- As a formalism exceptional field theory has found essential number of application, some of which have been described in this review in more details. In particular, we have covered generalized twist reductions of ExFTs, which reproduce lower-dimensional gauged supergravities, description of non-geometric brane backgrounds and an algorithm for generating deformations of supergravity backgrounds based on frame change inside DFT.

Based on the idea of stable, knotted vortices in the ether or [aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_theories), it contributed an important mathematical legacy.\n- The vortex theory of the atom was based on the observation that a stable [vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex) can be created in a fluid by making it into a ring with no ends. Such vortices could be sustained in the [luminiferous aether](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luminiferous_aether), a hypothetical fluid thought at the time to pervade all of space. In the vortex theory of the [atom](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom), a chemical atom is modelled by such a vortex in the aether.\n- Knots can be tied in the core of such a vortex, leading to the hypothesis that each [chemical element](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chemical_element) corresponds to a different kind of knot. The simple [toroidal vortex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toroidal_vortex), represented by the circular \"unknot\" 01, was thought to represent [hydrogen](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrogen). Many elements had yet to be discovered, so the next knot, the [trefoil knot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trefoil_knot) 31, was thought to represent [carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon).\n\nHowever, as more elements were discovered and the periodicity of their characteristics established in the [periodic table](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table) of the elements, it became clear that this could not be explained by any rational classification of knots.

Those points are equivalent to magnetic monopoles in the momentum space and are connected by Fermi arcs.\n- A combination of angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), modelling, density functional theory and careful calculations were used to confirm the existence of this new type of Weyl semimetal. This material provides an exciting new platform to study the properties of Weyl fermions, and may lead the way to more new materials with unusual transport properties.\n\n“This an important, interdisciplinary discovery because it allows us to study many aspects of these exotic particles predicted by high energy physics theory in solid state, without need for extremely expensive particle accelerators,” said Adam Kaminsky, Ames Laboratory scientist and professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at Iowa State University. “From my perspective as solid state physicist it is absolutely extraordinary to observe two bands touching each other at certain points and being connected by Fermi arcs – objects that are prohibited to exist in “ordinary” materials.” _([rdworldonline.com](https://www.rdworldonline.com/new-material-discovery-allows-study-of-elusive-weyl-fermion/))_\n```\n\n[![rd1608_fermion](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/d95795e8-1d97-49ce-b256-fa8df87748e2)](https://www.rdworldonline.com/new-material-discovery-allows-study-of-elusive-weyl-fermion/)\n\n***7 + 11 + 13 = 31***\n\n```txt\nThe True Prime Pairs:\n(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n\n |-------------------------------- 2x96 -------------------------------|\n❓ |--------------- 7¤ ---------------|------------ 7¤ ------------------|\n〰️43👉------------- {89} --------------|{12}|-- {30} -|-- {36} -|-- {25} -|\n +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n | 5 | 7 | 11 |{13}| 17 | 19 | 17 |{12}| 11 | 19 | 18 | 18 | 12 | 13 |\n +----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n |--------- {53} ---------|---- {48} ----|---- {48} ----|---- {43} ----👉89〰️\n |---------- 5¤ ----------|------------ {96} -----------|----- 3¤ -----| ❓\n |-------- Bosons --------|---------- Fermions ---------|-- Gravitons--|\n 13 variations 48 variations 11 variations \n```\n\n```note\nThis proposition was first demonstrated by Edwin Hubble (1889-1953).

However, the Higgs has never been definitively observed (MHiggs > 114 GeV at 95% CL [2]). \n- A Standard Model Higgs suffers from the so called hierarchy problem. The theory needs fine-tuned parameters to accomodate a light Higgs mass. Supersymmetry offers a solution to this problem, through a symmetry between fermions and bosons. \n- The Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model contains ***two Higgs doublets, leading to five physical Higgs bosons: Two neutral CP-even states (h and H), one neutral CP-odd (A), and two charged states (H+ and H~)***. \n- At tree-level, the masses are governed by two parameters, often taken to be mA and tan/3 [3]. When tan/3 > > 1 , ***A is nearly degenerate with one of the CP-even states (denoted φ)***. Where mA < 130 GeV (mA > 130), mA = mh (mA = mH).\n- In this same large tan/3 region, the cross sections for some production mechanisms such as pp -» Α(φ) and pp -» A($i)bb are enhanced by factors of tan /32(sec/32). For example, with Λ/S = 2 TeV, tan/3 = 30 and mA = 100 GeV, the cross sections for pp —>· A and pp —> φ are each of or-der 10 pb[4].\n- The cross section for pp -> Α/φΜ) is smaller, but within the same order of magnitude. In the same region, the branching ratios to Α/φ ->· bb and rr dominate, ***at ~ 90% and ~ 10%*** respectively, independent of mass. \n- Due to their similar masses, cross-sections and branching ratios in the high tan/3 region, we search for ***both A and φ simultaneously**$.\n- At the Tevatron, we search for pp —>> Α/φ —► rr (the bb final state is expected to be overwhelmed by dijet background) and pp ->· Α/φΰ) -» bbbb. \n- This search for pp -> Α/φ -> r+r~ is underway at CDF.

When a particle decays, it transforms into other particles (called decay products).\n\n```note\nAttempts to extend the Standard Model or other quantum field theories by adding gravitons run into serious theoretical difficulties at energies close to or above the [Planck scale](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planck_scale).\n- This is because of infinities arising due to quantum effects; technically, gravitation is not [renormalizable](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renormalizable).\n- Since classical general relativity and [quantum mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_mechanics) seem to be incompatible at such energies, from a theoretical point of view, this situation is not tenable.\n\nOne possible solution is to replace particles with [strings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_theory). String theories are quantum theories of gravity in the sense that they reduce to classical general relativity plus field theory at low energies, but are fully quantum mechanical, contain a graviton, and are thought to be mathematically consistent. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graviton))_\n```\n\n[![Search for The Graviton](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/378af784-1929-4e9a-9dc0-17e8a29f9325)](https://blog.thingswedontknow.com/2016/08/search-for-the-graviton.html)\n\nThere are 5 different string theories, ***each requiring 10 dimensions***. On the other hand, string theory is supposed to be fundamental theory.\n\n```warning\nIntroduced earlier in GUTS: The Unification of Forces Superstring theory is an attempt to unify gravity with the other three forces and, thus, must contain quantum gravity.\n- The main tenet of Superstring theory is that fundamental particles, including the graviton that carries the gravitational force, act like one-dimensional vibrating strings.\n- Since gravity affects the time and space in which all else exists, Superstring theory is an attempt at a Theory of Everything (TOE).\n- Each independent quantum number is thought of as a separate dimension in some super space (analogous to the fact that the familiar dimensions of space are independent of one another) and is represented by a different type of Superstring.\n- As the universe evolved after the Big Bang and forces became distinct (spontaneous symmetry breaking), some of the dimensions of superspace are imagined to have curled up and become unnoticed.\n- Forces are expected to be unified only at extremely high energies and at particle separations on the order of 10^-35m. This could mean that Superstrings must have dimensions or wavelengths of this size or smaller.\n- Just as quantum gravity may imply that there are no time intervals shorter than some finite value, it also implies that there may be no sizes smaller than some tiny but finite value. That may be about 10^-35m.\n- If so, and if Superstring theory can explain all it strives to, then the structures of Superstrings are at the lower limit of the smallest possible size and can have no further substructure.\n- This would be the ultimate answer to the question the ancient Greeks considered: There is a finite lower limit to space. Not only is Superstring theory in its infancy, it deals with dimensions about 17 orders of 10^-18m magnitude smaller than the details that we have been able to observe directly.\n- It is thus relatively unconstrained by experiment, and there are a host of theoretical possibilities to choose from. This has led theorists to make choices subjectively (as always) on what is the most elegant theory, with less hope than usual that experiment will guide them.\n- It has also led to ***speculation of alternate universes***, with their Big Bangs creating each new universe with a random set of rules. These speculations may not be tested even in principle, since an alternate universe is by definition unattainable. It is something like exploring a self-consistent field of mathematics, with its axioms and rules of logic that are not consistent with nature.\n\nSuch endeavors have often given insight to mathematicians and scientists alike and occasionally have been directly related to the description of new discoveries. _([College Physics 2e - pdf page 1518](https://assets.openstax.org/oscms-prodcms/media/documents/College_Physics_2e-WEB_7Zesafu.pdf))_\n```\n\n[![](https://github.com/eq19/feed/assets/8466209/6b9b301e-9076-4698-a641-83e29c1a5aa1)](https://byjus.com/physics/stringtheory/)\n\n```note\nWith William Thomson’s idea of _[vortex atoms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vortex_theory_of_the_atom)_ coming of age in the shape of string and superstring theories, in recent years hopes for a $nite theory of quantum gravity have centered on the quantum superstring (QSS).\n- Although the perturbation expansion yields finite terms, the summations do involve infinities [ 2481. However, that would still be true in quantum electrodynamics (QED) ; in perturbative treatments in quantum field theory these infinities are assumed to arise because of non-perturbative solutions and are regarded as an indication of the latter’s existence. Should we then consider the search for a theory of quantum gravity as having reached its goal and should we therefore cross it out as a motivation for the study of non-Riemannian gravitational theories?\n- The basic assumption in the post- 1984 treatment of the quantum superstring [ 2381 “theory of everything” \n(TOE), an on-mass-shell S-matrix type theory, is that its truncation below Planck mass should go over smoothly into an off-mass-shell relativistic quantum (point) local field theory * (including a version of ten-dimensional supergravity, in one sector of the “heterotic string” [ 2471, for instance) thus, even if the search were over, the same geometrical-gravitational question then relates to that truncated “low-energy” field theory and its gravitational sector. \n\nMoreover, it has been pointed out [ 1051 that consistency would then require the low-energy $eid theory to be fmite by itseIf! This then implies the existence of a finite or renormalizable relativistic quantum field theory of gravity. _([Gauge theory of gravity - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13804799/1-s2.0-037015739400111F-main_compressed.pdf))_\n```\n\n[![476931_1_En_1](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/bdd0ed5e-1e19-4647-9075-f7a0dc5024fd)](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13804640/1909.01791.pdf)\n\nThe [symmetry](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13815312/Gbook.pdf)\n of this _supergravity theory_ is given by the supergroup OSp(1\\32) which gives the subgroups O(1) for the bosonic and Sp(32) for the fermion. \n\n```note\nIn general relativity, gravity is a force that bends and warps space-time around supermassive bodies.\n- Even though gravity is one of the four fundamental forces in nature, it is very weak compared to the other three forces (electromagnetism, weak force and strong force). So it can’t be observed or identified on the scale of subatomic particles.\n- However, [gravity](https://byjus.com/physics/gravity/) is ***very dominant in long-distance scenarios***. It controls the structure of the macro universe (galaxies, planets, stars, moons).\n- As far as [quantum mechanics](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13787269/aqm.pdf)\n is concerned, gravity doesn’t have much effect. The probable nature of the quantum realm also poses a significant challenge for the induction of gravity in the quantum realm.\n- Generally, ***gravity does not act as a particle as its own***. Even if a hypothetical model is introduced to explain the particle nature of a gravity particle, it violates fundamental energy laws.\n\nIn the 1970s, theorists tried to discard the self-destructive idea of point-like gravity particles. Instead of point particles, strings were introduced. Even if strings collide, there will be no infinite energy problem. Strings can smoothly smash and rebound without implying any physically nonsense infinities.\n```\n\n[![An-adinkra-for-the-chiral-multiplet](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/6dec58db-4bc6-467e-8110-b28bc307a7b3)](https://www.eq19.com/identition/#series-expansion)\n\nThis standard model is missing the Gravitational interaction and it is postulated that there exists a particle called the Graviton that leads to ***supergravity theory***.\n\n```note\nSupergravity is an extension of supersymmetry, designed to include the principles of General Relativity. In order to make this possible, supersymmetry has to become local, with a spacetime-dependent spinor ǫ(x) parametrising the infinitesimal SUSY transformation.\n- The key ingredient of supergravity is the graviton hµν , a massless spin-2 elementary particle which couples to the stress-energy tensor, thus mediating gravitational interactions.\n- Its fermionic, spin-3/2 partner, the gravitino ψαµ, equipped both with a spinor index α and a spacetime index µ, is the gauge field of local supersymmetry and becomes massive when SUSY is broken, by absorbing the emerging goldstino in the so-called super-Higgs mechanism.\n- There are two ways in which the graviton can be related to the metric gµν, either through an infinitesimal expansion gµν = ηµν + hµν around the flat metric ηµν , or through the vielbein formalism.\n\nAs is well-known from General Relativity, the metric (and implicitly the graviton) has tosatisfy the Einstein’s field equations _([Holomorphic_Yukawa_Couplings - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13850219/Holomorphic_Yukawa_Couplings_in_Heterotic_String_T.pdf))_\n```\n\n[![NLFIW](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/36035b02-6ac5-492d-81b2-5b290c892703)](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13850219/Holomorphic_Yukawa_Couplings_in_Heterotic_String_T.pdf)\n\n\n```note\nThink of it this way, all gravitating bodies in the universe would be surrounded at all times by a cloud of tunneling electrons. We cannot see these particles since they’re so small and since they permeate all of space. They would also tunnel to a different location about once every Planck time (about 10^-43 seconds) whenever they interact with another particle.\n- These interactions between particles amount to the exchanges of bosons between electrons and other electrons or other fermions. At each point where the electron absorbs another boson, we say that the wave function of the electron collapses, and it tunnels to a new location whereupon it interacts with yet another particle.\n- The cloud of electron surrounding gravitating objects would diminish in inverse proportion to the square of the distance; hence, if you recede from an objects’ surface, you’re less likely to find an electron tunneling from that object.\n- Electrons also make an excellent candidate for a particle of gravity since they absorb and emit photons readily, and we know from Einstein’s theory of general relativity that light interacts readily with gravitational fields, and that gravitational fields are thought to emit photons spontaneously.\n- This spontaneous emission of photons is what we refer to as the cosmological constant or dark energy, and in our current thinking on the topic we imagine that particles of antimatter are created and annihilate with particles of matter leading, occasionally, to the emission of a photon. I suspect that this is incorrect and that no such thing as antimatter really exists. I suspect that positrons are really tunneling W particles and that this Dirac Sea, or background of tunneling electrons, is really giving rise to this phenomenon of the cosmological constant, or vacuum energy, we observe inn nature.\n- As a consequence, we would need to adumbrate our standard model of particle physics by about half. This ought to be seen as a positive thing in physics. No longer do we have untestable assumptions (such as the creation and annihilation of particles) in our models, and we have a far easier means of now beginning to probe the quantum nature of gravity.\n\nThe other fascinating consequence of this way of thinking is that gravity would no longer be a fundamental force; instead it would be a secondary effect of electromagnetism. This should have been what we anticipated all along; and now, we might have a quantum theory focusing on only three forces and a theory of gravitation that is truly particle-based. _([Medium - Article](https://medium.com/@cottlesam/quantum-gravity-will-force-us-to-cut-the-standard-model-in-half-c073e2033968))_\n```\n\n[![Cut the Standard Model](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/22d4a42b-da13-4a78-a3d1-e15ee5c611c6)](https://medium.com/@cottlesam/quantum-gravity-will-force-us-to-cut-the-standard-model-in-half-c073e2033968)\n\n```note\nThere are two groups of scientists (called collaborations) looking for evidence of gravitons in proton-proton collision experiments at the Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

The colors help this stand out. Let’s start with the top of the Y-Axis. ***All digits at the top of the Y-Axis reduce down to 1,7,4 or 5,2,8***.\n- This is important. Using this Prime Number Folio Coordinate System, it’s easier to think of prime numbers in separate sequences across from each other and right or left-handed rather than next to each other on a number line. I see them as Chiral.\n- All digits in on the right-hand side of the Y-Axis reduce down to 5, 2 or 8. (For example 179 has 3 digits, what matters is that the numbers 1 +7+9 sum to the number 8.) So this would be considered a right-handed prime number. Or a number on the right side of the Y-Axis.\n\nThe image stands on its own. The patterns should jump off the page. Especially with the color. Right-handed numbers have different properties than the left-handed numbers. These observations are in no way mathematically rigorous.\n- The numbers on the right side `(5,2,8)|` of the Y-Axis include not only prime numbers, but the products of the prime numbers combined from both sides of the Y-axis.\n- Every product on the right-hand side of the Y-Axis is created from two primes (or semi-primes or combination of semi-primes) from both sides of the Y-axis (one from each side), which ALWAYS sum to an exact multiple of 6. These are plotted on the right side of the X-Axis. (For example `7×11=77`. While `7+11=18`.)\n\nUsing this Folio Coordinate System, it’s easy to see how the products and sums and their distribution are directly related to each other. You might want to start thinking about the Goldbach Conjecture.\n- All products and sums on the right side are indigo/purple to show how they combine with the red and blue prime numbers.\n- It looks like we are simply adding 6 to each Axis/number line, when in fact we are adding the number 1 to each consecutive number but positioning it at different points while moving around both the X and Y Axis.\n- The colors should help your eye follow the numbers. Follow the colors of the rainbow/number combination to help you move around the system. `(R-1,O-2,Y-3,G-4,B-5,I-6)`.\n\n***The number 35 is an important number***. It’s the first number on the right-hand side that’s a product of two prime factors of `5 x 7 = 35`.\n- The sum of `5 + 7 = 12`. Since the right-handed numbers are distributed evenly by 6, we can add `7 x 6 = 42` to 35 and land on the number 77.\n- So now we know that starting with the number 35 if we add 42 continuously we will ***NEVER land on a prime number***. We can also add `5 x 6 = 42` to 35 and land on 65.\n- We also know that `7 + 11 = 18`. The next number that introduces a product of two primes is `5 x 13 = 65` and `5 + 13 = 18`. So we can take `6 x 13 = 78` and add this to 65 and land on 143. Which is the product of `11 x 13 = 143`.\n- Starting with 65 we can add 78 continuously and ***NEVER land on a prime number***.\n- In the meantime 77 (The product of 7 and 11 now introduces the prime number 11 into the mix. So `77 + (6x11) = 143`.\n- ***Starting with 77 we can add 66 continuously and NEVER land on a prime number***. \n\nYou can’t add multiples of 6 until that multiple is introduced into the sequence. The primes on the left behave differently. You can still move around using multiples of 6, but there is no common starting point like the number 35.\n- You have to start with the squares of ***5 at 25 (in blue)*** for one sequence of numbers and the square of ***7 at 49 (in red)*** for the other sequence of numbers.\n- The sums of these products are also not exact multiples of 6. They sum to 10 and 14 and are matched to the split X Axis on the left-hand side of the graph.\n\nThe Prime Number Folio Coordinate System and it’s natural numbers are all you need to find a prime number or a composite number and it’s factors. ***No need for complex numbers or the Reimann Hypothesis***. _([Medium](https://medium.com/invisible-illness/prime-number-folio-coordinate-system-78b316b65cf7))_\n```\n\nBeing brought forth you will also begin to uncover _[the irrelevant role](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13789887/4355025.pdf)_ that the Riemann hypothesis plays _[7 ate 9](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/10.html#symmetry-breaking)_ in understanding this elegant distribution.\n\n[![The Prime Number Folio Coordinate System ](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/285091346-8eb3dfda-4b06-4186-bf5d-a3050db5fe1b.png)](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SE6UamC9ew0fIraKHstytwjQMY4LmVe8/view)\n\n```note\nThis curve is a [polar plot](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:RiemannZeta_Zeros.svg) of _[the first 20](https://gist.github.com/eq19/b32915925d9d365e2e9351f0c4ed786e#file-2_assigning-md)_ non-trivial [Riemann zeta function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riemann_zeta_function) zeros including Gram points along the critical line _[ζ(1/2+t)](https://gist.github.com/eq19/b32915925d9d365e2e9351f0c4ed786e#file-fork-md)_ for real values of t running from 0 to 50.

The concept of matrix exponential is used in a fundamental way. We define a notion of matrix imaginary unit which generalizes the usual complex imaginary unit.

Also, we derive some exponential representation for matrix real and imaginary unit, and for the first [Pauli matrix](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13818844/math0703448.pdf)\n```\n\n[![ang5](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/f6dc49c5-261f-4a8d-8270-cd2f2c25a03d)\n](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/schomeru/lecturenotes/Quantum%20Mechanics/S16.html)\n\nThe distribution of prime numbers is a central point of study in _[number theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Number_theory)_. So let's start from there.\n\n```note\nThe Lorentz group consists, unsurprisingly, of the Lorentz transformations, which are the linear transformations preserving the Minkowski dot product. Equivalently, they are the linear transformations fixing that hyperboloid of two sheets. If we discard one of the sheets, we obtain the orthochronous (time-preserving) subgroup.\n- From the perspective of the centre of the cone, the hyperboloid looks like an open disc. The orthochronous Lorentz transformations precisely correspond to distance-preserving transformations of the hyperbolic plane. These are themselves determined uniquely by a conformal (or anticonformal) transformation of the ‘circle at infinity’.\n- Adding an extra dimension, the orthochronous Lorentz group O^{+}(3,1) is isomorphic to the group of distance-preserving transformations of hyperbolic 3-space, which is again isomorphic to the group of (anti-)conformal transformations of the ‘sphere at infinity’, namely our index-2 supergroup of the Möbius group.\n\nMoreover, this nicely generalises: the group generated by geometric inversions on the n-sphere is abstractly isomorphic to the orthochronous Lorentz group O^{+}(n+1,1). ***And when n = 24, we get a very beautiful discrete subgroup, namely the automorphism group of the II(25,1)*** lattice intimately related to the [Leech lattice](http://cp4space.wordpress.com/2013/09/12/leech-lattice/). _([Complex Projective 4-Space](https://cp4space.hatsya.com/2013/10/10/what-should-this-group-be-called/))_\n```\n\n![spacetime](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/ff442f14-c1c4-4e87-a3e5-8bc157d20e46)\n\n## Bispinor Structure\n\n```note\nThe Lie group structure of the Lorentz group is explored. Its generators and its Lie algebra are exhibited, via the study of infinitesimal Lorentz transformations.\n- The exponential map is introduced and it is shown that the study of the Lorentz group can be reduced to that of its Lie algebra.\n- Finally, the link between the restricted Lorentz group and the special linear group is established via the spinor map. \n\nThe Lie algebras of these two groups are shown to be identical (up to some isomorphism).\n```\n\n![270355_1_En_7_Fig1_HTML](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/5e3fd958-f39a-48b3-b747-6e05ac700572)\n\n```note\nThe four pairwise disjoint and non-compact connected components of the Lorentzgroup L = O(1, 3) and corresponding subgroups:\n- the proper Lorentz group L+ = SO(1, 3),\n- the orthochronous Lorentz group L↑,\n- the orthochronous Lorentz group Lo = L↑ + ∪ TL↑+ (see below) and\n- the proper orthochronous Lorentz group L↑+ = SO+(1, 3), which contains the identity element. \n\nOf course, the sets L↓−, L↑− and L↓+ do not represent groups due to the missing identity element. _([[The-four-pairwise-disjoint](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13810691/weyl_majorana_dirac_aste.pdf))_\n```\n\n[![The-four-pairwise-disjoint-and-non-compact-connected-components-of-the-Lorentz-group-L](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/f322446f-8726-4e51-bc5c-be1276c459c4)](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13810691/weyl_majorana_dirac_aste.pdf)\n\n```note\nSU(5) fermions of standard model in 5+10 representations.

They also have anti-colors: anti-red, anti-green and anti-blue. Like the electromagnetic force's positive and negative charges, different colors attract, and the same colors repel. Some particles that have color charge are quarks and antiquarks.\n- The type of quark is not related to that quark's color charge at all. Quarks are one of the smallest particles currently known. They take up no space because they are points, and they are the only particles that we have not been able to break apart from other particles yet. This is because the nature of the strong force between particles is that it becomes stronger the further away the particles are.\n\nThe force carrier of the strong force is called the gluon. Gluons also have color charge. Both quarks and gluons have properties that make them unique from other particles, as described in the Standard Model. _([Wikipedia](https://simple.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction))_.\n```\n\n![Nuclear_Force_anim](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/df0fb45e-8610-48d6-b9ff-dc0f19ba22c9)\n\n```note\nShortly after the existence of quarks was proposed by [Murray Gell-Mann](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Murray_Gell-Mann) and [George Zweig](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/George_Zweig) in 1964, [Moo-Young Han](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moo-Young_Han) and [Yoichiro Nambu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yoichiro_Nambu) introduced a hidden internal degree of freedom in which quark wave functions were antisymmetric, thus solving the spin-statistics problem of the Gell Mann-Zweig quark model.\n- Han and Nambu initially designated this degree of freedom by the group SU(3)', but it was referred to in later papers as \"the three triplet model.\" One feature of the model (which was originally preferred by Han and Nambu) was that it permitted integrally charged quarks, as well as the fractionally charged quarks initially proposed by Zweig and Gell-Mann.\n- Somewhat later, in the early 1970s, Gell-Mann, in several conference talks, coined the name \"Color\" to describe the internal degree of freedom of the three triplet model, and advocated a new field theory, designated as \"Quantum Chromodynamics\" (QCD) to describe the interaction of quarks and gluons within hadrons. In Gell-Mann's QCD, each quark and gluon had fractional electric charge, and carried what came to be called \"Color Charge\" in the space of the Color degree of freedom.\nIn quantum chromodynamics (QCD), a quark's color can take one of three values or charges: red, green, and blue. An antiquark can take one of three anticolors: called antired, antigreen, and antiblue (represented as cyan, magenta, and yellow, respectively). Gluons are mixtures of two colors, such as red and antigreen, which constitutes their color charge. QCD considers eight gluons of the possible nine color–anticolor combinations to be unique; see eight gluon colors for an explanation.\n- All three colors mixed together, or any one of these colors and its complement (or negative), is \"colorless\" or \"white\" and has a net color charge of zero. Due to a property of the strong interaction called color confinement, free particles must have a color charge of zero.\n- A baryon is composed of three quarks, which must be one each of red, green, and blue colors; likewise an antibaryon is composed of three antiquarks, one each of antired, antigreen and antiblue. A meson is made from one quark and one antiquark; the quark can be any color, and the antiquark has the matching anticolor.\n\nThe following illustrates the coupling constants for color-charged particles. In a quantum field theory, a coupling constant and a charge are different but related notions. The coupling constant sets the magnitude of the force of interaction; for example, in quantum electrodynamics, the fine-structure constant is a coupling constant. _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge))_\n```\n\n[![Neutron_QCD_Animation](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/9d318dfa-ef33-4653-bcc2-6a4f548e2d1d)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge)\n\n![IMG_20240111_062522](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/efe55c6d-926c-47bb-80db-7d892eb3f103)\n\n[![SO(10)](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/b1d3bccd-a423-4ebb-a397-e973b2cc8e6e)\n](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Unified_Theory)\n\nThis diagram is representing groupings (leptons, quarks, weak-force bosons) with 6 quarks in a way that par\nallels the 6 leptons.\n\n```note\nIn [physics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physics), and specifically in [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory), a bispinor is a mathematical construction that is used to describe some of the [fundamental particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_particle) of [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature), including [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark) and [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron).\n- It is a specific embodiment of a [spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor), specifically constructed so that it is consistent with the requirements of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity).\n- Bispinors transform in a certain \"spinorial\" fashion under the action of the [Lorentz group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group), which describes the symmetries of [Minkowski spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_spacetime).\n- They occur in the relativistic [spin-1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-1/2) [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function) solutions to the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation).\n- Bispinors are so called because they are constructed out of two simpler component spinors, the [Weyl spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_spinor). Each of the two component spinors transform differently under the two distinct complex-conjugate spin-1/2 [representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(mathematics)) of the Lorentz group.\n- This pairing is of fundamental importance, as it allows the represented particle to have a [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass), carry a [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics)), and represent the flow of charge as a [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether_current), and perhaps most importantly, to carry [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum).[![ang5](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/f6dc49c5-261f-4a8d-8270-cd2f2c25a03d)\n](https://www.lancaster.ac.uk/staff/schomeru/lecturenotes/Quantum%20Mechanics/S16.html)\n- More precisely, the mass is a [Casimir invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_invariant) of the Lorentz group (an eigenstate of the energy), while the vector combination carries momentum and current, being [covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors) under the action of the Lorentz group.\n- The angular momentum is carried by the [Poynting vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting_vector), suitably constructed for the spin field.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bispinor#cite_note-1)\n- A bispinor is more or less \"the same thing\" as a [Dirac spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_spinor).

The oldest stars in the Milky Way are nearly as old as the Universe itself and thus probably formed shortly after the Dark Ages of the Big Bang.[42] _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Milky_Way))_\n```\n\n```txt\nE = mc²\nm = E/c²\n\nc = 1 light-second\n = 1000 years x L / t\n = 12,000 months x 2152612.336257 km / 86164.0906 sec\n = 299,792.4998 km / sec\n\nNote:\n1 year = 12 months\n1000 years = 12,000 months\nTe = earth revolution = 365,25636 days\nR = radius of moon rotation to earth = 384,264 km\nV = moon rotation speed = 2πR/Tm = 3682,07 km/hours\nVe = excact speed = V cos (360° x Tm/Te) = V cos 26,92848°\nTm = moon revolution (sidereal) = 27,321661 days = 655,719816 hours\nt = earth rotation (sinodik) = 24 hours = 24 x 3600 sec = 86164.0906 sec\nL = Ve x Tm = 3682,07 km/hours x cos 26,92848° x 655,71986 = 2152612.336257 km\n\nConclusion:\nπ(π(π(π(π(32(109²-89²)))))) Universe vs Unknown vs Unknowns (mass of matter)\n 👇\nπ(π(π(π(32(109²-89²))))) Galaxies vs Universe vs Unknown (gap in 2nd-level)\n 👇\nπ(π(π(32(109²-89²)))) Sun vs Galaxies vs Universe (2nd gap in 1st-level)\n 👇\nπ(π(32(109²-89²))) Moon vs Sun vs Galaxies (1st-gap via dark matter) \n 👇\n|--👇---------------------------- 2x96 ---------------------|\n|--👇----------- 7¤ ---------------|---------- 5¤ ----------|\n|- π(32(109²-89²))=109² -|-- {36} -|-------- {103} ---------|\n+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n| 5 | 7 | 11 |{13}| 17 | 19 | 17 |{12}| 11 | 19 | 18 |{43}|\n+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+----+\n|--------- {53} ---------|---- {48} ----|---- {48} ----|109²-89² 👉\n|---------- 5¤ ----------|------------ {96} -----------|-1¤-|\n|-------- Bosons --------|---------- Fermions ---------|-- Graviton\n|----- (Sun Orbit) ------|-------- (Moon Orbit) -------| (11 Galaxies) ✔️\n|------------ Part of 1 Galaxy (Milky Way) ------------| Non Milky Way ✔️\n```\n\n![](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/221572263-652e1309-03f3-4a51-a71f-1f48ff06c120.png)\n\n```txt\nThe Prime Recycling ζ(s):\n(2,3), (29,89), (36,68), (72,42), (100,50), (2,3), (29,89), ...**infinity**\n----------------------+-----+-----+-----+ ---\n 7 --------- 1,2:1| 1 | 30 | 40 | 71 (2,3) ‹-------------@---- |\n | +-----+-----+-----+-----+ | |\n | 8 ‹------ 3:2| 1 | 30 | 40 | 90 | 161 (7) ‹--- | 5¨ encapsulation\n | | +-----+-----+-----+-----+ | | |\n | | 6 ‹-- 4,6:3| 1 | 30 | 200 | 231 (10,11,12) ‹--|--- | |\n | | | +-----+-----+-----+-----+ | | | ---\n --|--|-----» 7:4| 1 | 30 | 40 | 200 | 271 (13) --› | {5®} | |\n | | +-----+-----+-----+-----+ | | |\n --|---› 8,9:5| 1 | 30 | 200 | 231 (14,15) ---------› | 7¨ abstraction\n289 | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ | |\n | ----› 10:6| 20 | 5 | 10 | 70 | 90 | 195 (19) --› Φ | {6®} |\n --------------------+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ | ---\n 67 --------› 11:7| 5 | 9 | 14 (20) --------› ¤ | |\n | +-----+-----+-----+ | |\n | 78 ‹----- 12:8| 9 | 60 | 40 | 109 (26) «------------ | 11¨ polymorphism\n | | +-----+-----+-----+ | | |\n | | 86‹--- 13:9| 9 | 60 | 69 (27) «-- Δ19 (Rep Fork) | {2®} | |\n | | | +-----+-----+-----+ | | ---\n | | ---› 14:10| 9 | 60 | 40 | 109 (28) ------------- ✔️ | |\n | | +-----+-----+-----+ | |\n | ---› 15,18:11| 1 | 30 | 40 | 71 (29,30,31,32) ---------- 13¨ inheritance\n329 | +-----+-----+-----+ |\n | ‹--------- 19:12| 10 | 60 | {70} (36) ‹--------------------- Φ |\n -------------------+-----+-----+ ---\n 786 ‹------- 20:13| 90 | 90 (38) ‹-------------- ¤ |\n | +-----+-----+ |\n | 618 ‹- 21,22:14| 8 | 40 | 48 (40,41) ‹---------------------- 17¨ class\n | | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ | |\n | | 594 ‹- 23:15| 8 | 40 | 70 | 60 | 100 | 278 (42) «-- |{6'®} |\n | | | +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ | | ---\n --|--|-»24,27:16| 8 | 40 | 48 (43,44,45,46) ------------|---- |\n | | +-----+-----+ | |\n --|---› 28:17| 100 | {100} (50) ------------------------» 19¨ object\n168 | +-----+ |\n| 102 -› 29:18| 50 | 50(68) ---------> Δ18 |\n----------------------+-----+ ---\n```\n\n***1st Fermion Fields = 96 / 12 Moon Orbit = 8 (1st-gap)***\n\n[![8 (1st-gap)](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/5c478950-c4e2-4a83-b5c9-ec1e36cd6fa1)](https://www.eq19.com/#identition-zones)\n\n## Truncated Perturbation\n\n```note\nSU(5) fermions of standard model in 5+10 representations.

He made the following conjectures which were proved in 1954 by _[Peter Swinnerton-Dyer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Swinnerton-Dyer)_ an English mathematician specialising in _[number theory](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#number-theory)_.\n\n```note\nDayson's friend the neurologist and author Oliver Sacks said: \"A favourite word of Freeman's about doing science and being creative is the word ***subversive*** (tending or intending to subvert or overthrow, destroy, or undermine an established or existing system, especially a legally constituted or a set of beliefs), and he's done that all his life _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Dyson#Biography))_.\n```\n\n```\nN(0, 5, 5n + 4) = N(1, 5, 5n + 4) = N(2, 5, 5n + 4) = N(3, 5, 5n + 4) = N(4, 5, 5n + 4)\nN(0, 7, 7n + 5) = N(1, 7, 7n + 5) = N(2, 7, 7n + 5) = . . . = N(6, 7, 7n + 5)\n```\n\nThe concepts of rank and crank can both be used to classify partitions of certain integers into subclasses of equal size. The two concepts produce different subclasses of partitions. This is illustrated in the following two tables.\n\n```note\nAlthough not in the form that Dayson have defined, it was found that the last problem on which Ramanujan worked on before his death was cranks. Berndt and his coauthors have given substantial evidence that Ramanujan knew about the function _([Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank_of_a_partition#Ramanujan_and_cranks))_.\n```\n\n[![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/228412737-ab2f87a4-cdb1-4dc6-9a8c-907edef0ed19.png)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crank_of_a_partition#Basic_result)\n\nThe subclasses of partitions develops characters similar to the distribution of prime numbers. This results in a fundamental causal relation to the primes, systemically the products are entered into the position system. \n\n```txt\n$True Prime Pairs:\n(5,7), (11,13), (17,19)\n\n-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ ---\n 19¨ | 3¨ | 4¨ | 6¨ | 6¨ | 4¤ -----> current discussion |\n-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |\n 17¨ | {5¨}| {3¨}| 2¨ | 7¨ | 4¤ -----> assigned to \"id:31\" |\n +-----+-----+-----+-----+ |\n{12¨}| 6¨ | 6¨ | 2¤ (M & F) -----> assigned to \"id:32\" |\n +-----+-----+-----+ 17¤\n 11¨ | 3¨ | {3¨}| {5¨}| 3¤ -----> assigned to \"id:33\" |\n-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ |\n 19¨ | 4¨ | 4¨ | 5¨ | 6¨ | 4¤ -----> assigned to \"id:34\" |\n +-----+-----+-----+-----+ ---\n{18¨}| 5¨ | 5¨ | 8¨ | 3¤ -----> assigned to \"id:35\" |\n +-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ 12¤\n 43¨ | {3¨}| {5¨}| 5¨ | {5¨}| {3¨}| 7¨ | {5¨}| {3¨}| 7¨ | 9¤ (C1 & C2) |\n-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+-----+ ---\n139¨ |----- 13¨ -----|------ 15¨ ------|------ 15¨ ------|\n | 1 2 3 | 4 5 6 | 7 8 9 |\n Δ Δ Δ \n```\n\nA seemingly unrelated construction is the j-function of number theory.

specifically in [quantum field theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_field_theory), a bispinor is a mathematical construction that is used to describe some of the [fundamental particles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_particle) of [nature](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nature), including [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark) and [electrons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electron).\n- It is a specific embodiment of a [spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spinor), specifically constructed so that it is consistent with the requirements of [special relativity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special_relativity).\n- Bispinors transform in a certain \"spinorial\" fashion under the action of the [Lorentz group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group), which describes the symmetries of [Minkowski spacetime](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minkowski_spacetime).\n- They occur in the relativistic [spin-1/2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin-1/2) [wave function](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave_function) solutions to the [Dirac equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_equation).\n- Bispinors are so called because they are constructed out of two simpler component spinors, the [Weyl spinors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weyl_spinor).\n- Each of the two component spinors transform differently under the two distinct complex-conjugate spin-1/2 [representations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representation_(mathematics)) of the Lorentz group.\n- This pairing is of fundamental importance, as it allows the represented particle to have a [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass), carry a [charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_(physics)), and represent the flow of charge as a [current](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Noether_current), and perhaps most importantly, to carry [angular momentum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum).\n- More precisely, the mass is a [Casimir invariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Casimir_invariant) of the Lorentz group (an eigenstate of the energy), while the vector combination carries momentum and current, being [covariant](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Covariance_and_contravariance_of_vectors) under the action of the Lorentz group.\n- The angular momentum is carried by the [Poynting vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poynting_vector), suitably constructed for the spin field.[[1]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bispinor#cite_note-1)\n- A bispinor is more or less \"the same thing\" as a [Dirac spinor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dirac_spinor). The convention used here is that the article on the Dirac spinor presents [plane-wave](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane-wave) solutions to the Dirac equation using the Dirac convention for the [gamma matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma_matrices). That is, the Dirac spinor is a bispinor in the Dirac convention.\n\nBy contrast, the article below concentrates primarily on the Weyl, or chiral representation, is less focused on the Dirac equation, and more focused on the geometric structure, including the geometry of the [Lorentz group](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lorentz_group).

As such a quantum with large mass and positive or negative charge has never been found by the experiment, the above theory seems to be on a wrong line. We can show, however, that, in the ordinary nuclear transformation, such a quantum can not be emitted into outer space. _(page 54)_\n\nThe interaction of such a quantum with the heavy particle should

The heavier muons and taus will rapidly change into electrons and neutrinos through a process of [particle decay](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_decay): the transformation from a higher mass state to a lower mass state.\n- Thus electrons are stable and the most common charged lepton in the [universe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universe), whereas muons and taus can only be produced in [high energy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/High_energy_physics) collisions (such as those involving [cosmic rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_ray) and those carried out in [particle accelerators](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Particle_accelerator)).\n- Leptons have various [intrinsic properties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intrinsic_properties), including [electric charge](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electric_charge), [spin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spin_(physics)), [mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass).\n- Unlike [quarks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark), however, leptons are not subject to the [strong interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_interaction), but they are subject to the other three [fundamental interactions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fundamental_interaction): [gravitation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitation), the [weak interaction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction), and to ***[electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism)***, of which the latter is proportional to charge, and is thus zero for the electrically neutral neutrinos.\n\n[![Electrodynamics](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/b8629985-8996-4819-9e19-a106b98eed48)](https://www.eq19.com/multiplication/#beyond-the-96)\n\nFor every lepton flavor, there is a corresponding type of [antiparticle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle), known as an antilepton, that differs from the lepton only in that some of its properties have [equal magnitude but opposite sign](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charge_conjugation).

This seemingly innocuous difference marks an important change in the conceptual basis of quantum physics.\n- Its historical, theoretical, and conceptual roots are here reconstructed. The link between Weinberg's proof and Pauli's original is highlighted: Weinberg's proof turns out to do justice to Pauli's anti-Dirac lines of thought.\n\nThe work of Furry and Oppenheimer is also surveyed as a “third way” between the textbook tradition established by _[Pauli and Weinberg's approach - pdf](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/files/13774357/1-s2.0-S1355219803000662-main.pdf)_\n```\n\n[![Increasing_disorder svg](https://github.com/eq19/eq19.github.io/assets/8466209/78c62ab2-c94b-4b4b-a76b-6fe3ffeb1c06)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1355219803000662)\n\nThis is nothing but ***[Pauli's Exclusion Principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pauli_exclusion_principle)*** forbidding the possibility of any two indistinguishable particles being in the same dynamic state (Pauli, 1925).\n\n## Irrational Partitions\n\nBy this exponentiation zones we will get multiple layers of primes density.

Thus, we are still able to apply the [Schröninger wave equation](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#the-three-3-zones) in the haptic space, and ***replace the Hamiltonian*** with our measurements.\n[![default](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/228989527-2915b89f-dd8c-40d9-ae64-3d69c5217b3d.png)](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#eulers-identity)\n\nThe problems would arise when the Windows Container in Github deliver the _[RNA Primer](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#scenario)_ to Google instance as [Windows Image](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#system-images) because it shall read the image while the _[COS](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#diagram-of-classes)_ is run under Linux. So it will need to [proof and solve](https://mikinty.github.io/P-vs-NP/) without actually having to try.\n \n```note\nIf it is easy to check that a solution to a problem is correct, is it also easy to solve the problem? This is the essence of the P vs NP question. Typical of the NP problems is that of the ***Hamiltonian Path Problem*** given N cities to visit, how can one do this without visiting a city twice? _([Clay Institute](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems))_.\n```\n\n[![P vs NP Problem](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/8466209/222922021-70011b19-25e8-4851-b72a-db41f24a14c2.png)](https://www.claymath.org/millennium-problems/p-vs-np-problem)\n\nGetting the [proofreading ability](https://gist.github.com/eq19/e9832026b5b78f694e4ad22c3eb6c3ef#encapsulation-scenario) of DNA polymerase to quickly solve problem for about one mistake for every billion base pairs copied is somehow that required by one of a major unsolved problem in theoretical computer science called ***[P vs NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem)***.\n\n```note\nP vs. NP deals with the gap between computers being able to quickly solve problems vs. just being able to test proposed solutions for correctness.

Thus it would mean that using Euler's identity to get a definite pattern of prime distribution is still a long way to go.\n","dir":"/multiplication/","name":"29.md","path":"multiplication/29.md","url":"/multiplication/29.html"}]
